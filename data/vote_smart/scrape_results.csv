0,Mark Totten,"Justice for victims.A few years ago Mark began service as a volunteer federal prosecutor, in addition to his full-time work teaching at MSU College of Law. Lending his expertise in appeals, Mark took on a series of challenging cases and won critical decisions that not only kept dangerous offenders behind bars, but strengthened the laws across Michigan to prevent future crimes and more victims.Mark worked tirelessly, at times giving more than 50 hours of volunteer service a week to protect Michigan families. His tough advocacy protected children from child predators, victims of domestic violence from their abusers, and senior-citizens and low-income folks from predatory lenders. Mark has ensured justice for victims and he'll do the same as Attorney General.Preventing crime; not just reacting to it.Like any prosecutor, Mark loves winning a case. At the same time, he understands it's far better to prevent a crime from happening in the first place. Just talking tough on crime -- while acting dumb on crime -- leaves us less safe. Here's a few ways Mark will be smart on crime.Advocate for education. The evidence is undeniable that kids who drop out of school are much more likely to enter a life of crime. And so the next time the legislature considers yet another round of cuts to public education and the resources our schools need to educate children, Mark will make sure the legislature, the Governor, and the public clearly understand the implications for public safety of the continued assault on public education.Champion prisoner re-entry programs. The old approach of simply warehousing idle prisoners and then dumping them on the streets after they've served their sentence has failed. That approach means more crime and more victims. Mark will support and expand programs like Prison Re-Entry, which prepares prisoners who have served their time to transition back into society as working, law-abiding citizens.",Issue Position: Justice for Victims and Preventing Crime
0,Mark Totten,"Michigan has been one of the states hardest hit by the financial crisis. Whether by foreclosure, falling home prices, or the loss of jobs that followed, we've all been harmed.As Attorney General, Mark Totten will lead the fight to protect Michigan families. He'll demand accountability from wrongdoers, including predatory lenders as well as their Wall Street backers. He'll fight to recover losses for victims. And he'll push for necessary new laws and strong enforcement to ensure these harms never happen again.When fifteen state attorneys general around the nation filed lawsuits against Standard and Poor's -- the credit rating agency on Wall Street that said everything was safe and sound in the years leading up to the crisis -- Michigan's Attorney General was nowhere to be found. When corporations harm people, Mark will be the People's Lawyer.",Issue Position: Protecting Families from Foreclosures and Financial Harm
0,Mark Totten,"Mark will fight to repeal Schuette's drug immunity law, which Schuette championed and passed in 1995, making Michigan the only state in the nation that gives drug companies complete immunity when their products harm or even kill parents and children -- as long as the drug was FDA-approved.Moreover, Bill Schuette has failed to defend Michigan's Consumer Protection Act. This critical law protects people who are harmed by products they buy or services they use. As a result, Michigan's consumer protections are some of the weakest in the nation. As Michigan's Attorney General, Mark Totten will restore consumer protections in Michigan and use those powers to protect Michigan citizens who suffer harm.",Issue Position: Standing-Up for Consumers
0,Mark Totten,"Michigan's Freedom of Information Act and Open Meetings Act protect the political process: they don't guarantee outcomes, but they ensure decision making happens in the sunlight and subject to public scrutiny. Without these vital laws, voters would be unable to hold their elected officials accountable at the polls.The Governor's recent ""Skunk Works"" project -- a stealth campaign to reshape public education with a voucher-like system that was shielded from public scrutiny by conducting official business on personal emails -- exposed one of many weakness in the system. As Attorney General, Mark Totten would issue a formal opinion to close these loopholes.",Issue Position: Ensuring Ethics and Transparency in Government
0,Mark Totten,"The Attorney General has a special responsibility to protect our military service members and veterans -- to serve those who serve. Michigan citizens serving abroad should never return home to find their homes foreclosed. And when the call to serve comes, they should be able to fulfill their mission without worrying about predatory schemes targeting them or their families.When over twenty attorneys general took on www.GIBill.com -- a marketing scheme by for-profit colleges that deceptively presented themselves to veterans as a federally-sponsored website -- Michigan was missing in action. Mark Totten won't just talk about serving those who serve; he'll fight as hard for our servicemen and women at home as they fight for us abroad.",Issue Position: Serving Those Who've Served

Hikers and hunters, boaters and beachgoers, paddlers and photographers -- and everyone else who simply likes to go for a walk in the woods or a stroll on the beach -- love what Michigan offers.But without active care and accountability, Michigan's Great Lakes and Great Outdoors will suffer. And what Michiganders love today will not be here tomorrow, let alone for future generations.The Michigan Attorney General plays a critical role protecting our lakes and lands. All the laws on the books are meaningless without an active AG who enforces the law. As AG, Mark will hold polluters accountable and send the message to would-be-polluters that the costs of wrongdoing far outweigh any perceived benefits of breaking the law.",Issue Position: Preserving our Great Lakes and Great Outdoors
0,Mark Schauer,"For eight years, President Bush and his Republican allies ignored growing risks in the financial markets as Wall Street and big banks exploited loopholes and harmed America's families and small businesses. Their failure to regulate financial markets and control these risks left Wall Street and the big banks to gamble with our money, which compromised our future, our savings, and the American Dream. We know what happened: the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.That's why Mark has supported legislation that will end taxpayer-funded bailouts and ""too big to fail' financial institutions, protect consumers from predatory lending, safeguard our retirement and college savings from unnecessary risks, and inject transparency and new accountability into a financial system run amok.Mark thinks we can't afford to spend another dime on more taxpayer-funded bank bailouts that leave consumers and small business owners in Michigan behind. We simply can't afford to put our economic recovery at risk by allowing Wall Street bankers to police themselves.",Issue Position: Wall Street Accountability
0,Mark Schauer,"Mark was a proud supporter of legislation signed into law this year that will help fix our broken health care system. Doing nothing would've allowed the powerful health insurance companies to keep raising premiums on Michigan families and businesses by double digits each year, Medicare would be put at risk for Michigan seniors, and the federal deficit would continue to skyrocket. Mark felt this course was simply unsustainable.Health care reform will ban health insurance companies from denying coverage due to pre-existing conditions or the loss of a job, close the Medicare prescription drug donut hole for 9,600 seniors in the 7th district, extend coverage to 24,000 uninsured local residents, cut the federal deficit by $1.3 trillion, and allow the American people to sign up for the same kind of quality, affordable, private health insurance plans that are available to members of Congress.In the days leading up to the final vote on health care reform, the health insurance industry spent nearly $400,000 on ads attacking Mark in a desperate attempt to scare Michigan families and maintain the status quo. Despite this massive misinformation campaign, Mark made it clear that he doesn't work for the powerful health insurance industry - he works for the people of Michigan, and isn't afraid to do what's right to fix our broken health care system and get our economy back on track.",Issue Position: Health Care
0,Mark Schauer,"Unfair trade deals have forced Michigan businesses and workers to compete on an uneven playing field with other countries, costing us hundreds of thousands of jobs over the past decade. When Mark ran for Congress in 2008, he made a promise that the first bill he'd sign up to support would tackle these unfair trade deals - and less than two weeks after taking office, he kept that promise by co-sponsoring the Trade Enforcement Act.Since then, Mark has supported legislation to fully repeal NAFTA - which has hurt Michigan manufacturers and sent hundreds of thousands of jobs to Mexico.Additionally, after discovering that materials used to promote the 2010 Census were made in China earlier this year, Mark introduced a bill that would ban Chinese companies from bidding on contracts with the U.S. government, since China has blocked American companies from its own government contracts.Mark is committed to leveling the playing field for Michigan businesses and workers by fighting for fair trade policies that will help put people back to work.",Issue Position: Trade
0,Mark Schauer,"Issue position: Economic StewardshipMichigan's economic success depends on creating strong trade policies that take into account the needs of American manufacturers and workers, addressing the health care crisis, advancing renewable energy policies that help create jobs and protect our resources, and tackling this foreclosure crisis.The Bush Administration and the Republicans in Congress have refused to enforce or pursue strong trade policies and the outsourcing crisis. I would join with Senators Levin and Stabenow as well as Michigan's Congressional delegation to demand a strong stance on trade - one that protects jobs and allows Michigan--and the United States--to compete.In the state Senate, I have worked to bring business and labor together to protect and expand jobs in our area. I've worked with Michigan companies like Kellogg's, Duncan Aviation, Michigan International Speedway, Sparton Corporation, Eaton Aerospace and others, helping them to stay in Michigan and grow their businesses.

I believe addressing climate change and retaining manufacturing jobs are not mutually exclusive. We can find common sense policies and invest in cutting-edge technology that allows us to accomplish our goals. We must continue to invest in alternative energy technologies that will reduce our dependence on foreign oil, reduce carbon emissions, and help to reserve our land, air, and water.Another important way we must protect our water, especially here in Michigan, is to continue our opposition to drilling in the Great Lakes and rein in large water withdrawals.

I would always put the need to ensure and expand health care insurance coverage for children ahead of party politics or ideology. In fact, I helped lead an effort here in Michigan to push for a strong federal children's health insurance program, sponsoring an initiative in the State Senate and traveling throughout the state to set the record straight about this important measure. In Congress, I would work in a bipartisan way with my colleagues to preserve this critical initiative.

Prior to being elected to office, I was responsible for helping to administer Head Start programs, and I saw firsthand the positive effects they had on children's development. I will focus on supporting and expanding initiatives like these.Finally, we have to make sure we're ensuring access to higher education and keeping it affordable.

Still the President and his allies have no plan and no exit strategy--but continue to spend $400 million on this war each day.One of my first official acts as a state Senator in 2003 was to vote against a resolution in support of President Bush's strategy in Iraq.

0,Mark Schauer,"The Honorable Barack ObamaPresident of the United StatesThe White House1600 Pennsylvania AvenueWashington, DC 20500Dear President Obama:We write today to express our strong support for Social Security and our view that it should be strengthened. We oppose any cuts to Social Security benefits, including raising the retirement age. We also oppose any effort to privatize Social Security, in whole or in part.You have charged the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform with proposing recommendations that improve the long-term fiscal outlook and address the growth of entitlement spending. It is our view that Social Security--which is prohibited by law from adding to the national budget deficit--does not belong as part of those recommendations.By 2023, Social Security will have built up a $4.3 trillion surplus, and, without any action, can pay full benefits until 2037 and at least 75 percent of all benefits thereafter. Because Social Security is funded separately from the general treasury and has no borrowing authority, it has not contributed to the federal deficit. Despite these facts, some Commission members have repeatedly alleged the need to cut Social Security for budgetary reasons.For 75 years, Social Security has been a promise to the American people that if they work hard and pay their fair share, they will have a financially secure retirement. In communities across this country, Social Security benefits are often the only source of income helping families maintain a decent standard of living. Social Security's benefits are modest, averaging less than $13,000 a year, but they are vital to the vast majority of Americans who receive them.Cutting Social Security benefits beyond the already scheduled increase in the retirement age from 65 to 67 would create even more needless hardship for millions of vulnerable Americans. This is especially true in the face of an economic downturn that has wiped out trillions of dollars that Americans were relying on for their retirement security and the increased dismantlement of the private and public pension systems.If any of the Commission's recommendations cut or diminish Social Security in any way, we will stand firmly against them. We urge you to join us in protecting and strengthening Social Security rather than letting it fall victim to a misguided attempt to reduce budget deficits on the backs of working families.Sincerely,Raul M.

In a letter to the International Joint Commission (IJC), Feingold and 15 other lawmakers urged the IJC to consider the ban at the IJC's Semi-Annual Meeting in Ottawa on October 19-22, 2010. Currently, Canada has hundreds of active wells in Lake Erie and allows drilling for oil and natural gas under the Great Lakes from onshore wells, and drilling for natural gas in the Great Lakes from offshore wells. While new U.S.-based oil and gas drilling in the Great Lakes is banned, seven grand-fathered oil and gas operations continue in Michigan, tapping into Lakes Michigan and Huron from their shores.""While the U.S. has banned new oil and gas drilling in the Great Lakes, Canada has yet to follow suit,"" Feingold said. ""Banning U.S.-based drilling is only half the battle. With the Great Lakes providing drinking water to millions and acting as an economic engine for the Midwest, I hope Canada seriously considers our request to end its current oil and gas drilling.""Feingold has a long record of protecting the Great Lakes from numerous threats like oil drilling, invasive species and pollution, to name a few. Last week, Feingold sent letters to the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission and Environment Canada calling into question a proposal to ship radioactive nuclear waste from Canada to Sweden via the Great Lakes. Feingold has also been a leading Senate opponent of drilling in the Great Lakes, cosponsoring the Great Lakes Water Protection Act and the successful 2001 amendment that put in place the first federal ban on oil or gas drilling in any of the Great Lakes.

The House passed the Currency Reform for Fair Trade Act (H.R. 2378), which will give the U.S. needed tools to enforce the rules of trade, help American businesses to compete in international markets, increase manufacturing, and create more jobs here at home.""For years we have watched our country's trade deficit with China grow due to unfair practices like currency manipulation, this bill will force China to play by the rules,"" said Schauer. ""It's time we stopped shipping our jobs overseas, and I'm committed to helping American businesses and manufacturers create jobs here at home for our workers, not workers in China.""China has a long history of suppressing the value of its currency to make exports cheaper than they would be if it allowed its currency to be set by the market. Nobel Prize winning economist Paul Krugman estimates that China's currency policy reduces U.S. GDP by 1.4 percentage points annually. C. Fred Bergsten, director of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, says the revaluation of China's currency would create 500,000 manufacturing jobs here in the United States.According to a recent report from the Economic Policy Institute, 2.4 million American jobs have been lost or displaced as a result of the growing trade deficit with China since it joined the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001. During that time, the State of Michigan lost 67,800 jobs, including 4,700 in the 7th district alone, due to unfair trade with China.In May, Schauer introduced the bipartisan Reciprocal Government Procurement with China Creates American Jobs Act (H.R. 5312).

Schauer's CLEAN Act would retain the ""immediate"" requirement, but create an outside cap of one hour after the discovery of a leak.Companies that exceed the one-hour requirement or violate other pipeline safety requirements would face a penalty of $250,000, up from the current $100,000, and penalties would increase to $2.5 million from $1 million for companies having multiple related violations.The bill would also increase transparency by creating a public, searchable internet database of all reportable incidents involving gas or hazardous liquid pipelines, holding companies accountable for the damage they cause.Schauer will continue working to improve pipeline safety during the reauthorization process for the U.S. Department of Transportation's Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA). He is also a co-sponsor of Congresswoman Jackie Speier's (D-CA) Pipeline Safety and Community Empowerment Act, which would help educate communities about the pipelines that run through them, increase oversight, and improve public safety.","U.S. House Passes Schauer Pipeline Safety Bill

We strongly support the Steelworkers Section 301 petition and urge the Administration to devote the necessary resources to USTR to address these and other unfair trade practices.""Text of the letter to President Obama follows:September 28, 2010The PresidentThe White HouseWashington, D.C. 20500Dear Mr. President:We write to express our strong concern regarding China's use of unfair trade practices to promote the global competitiveness of its industries. Such practices are widespread, and should be addressed in every sector in which they occur. We write today, however, with urgency about China's use of such unfair trade practices to bolster and, in fact, globally dominate the green technology sector, and to ask that you swiftly mobilize Administration resources to address these practices.In this regard, we support the petition filed by the United Steel, Paper and Forestry, Rubber, Manufacturing, Energy, Allied Industrial and Services Workers International Union, AFL-CIO CLC (""Steelworkers"") under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 (""Section 301"") on September 9, 2010, and urge your Administration to take prompt action to address the practices underlying this petition.China's proliferation of unfair trade practices continues unabated with dire consequences for U.S. workers, business and innovators. Upon entry into the World Trade Organization (""WTO"") in 2001, China agreed to remove its existing barriers to trade and to not adopt new barriers. Nearly a decade later, however, China has not followed through on many commitments, and has developed a new generation of discriminatory and unfair trade practices designed to protect and promote its domestic industries at the expense of U.S. jobs, commerce and know-how.China's approach to green technology policy exemplifies this grim trend. Through a variety of predatory trade practices, China's industrial policy seeks to give its manufacturers an unfair advantage in the green technology revolution and to capture this emerging sector. These practices, combined with Chinese currency policy, are already taking a heavy toll on the U.S. green economy and U.S. trade balances.The United States cannot stand on the side lines. It must take urgent and decisive enforcement action to secure a level playing field for fair competition for green technology manufacturers. The Office of the United States Trade Representative (""USTR"") has a strong enforcement record with respect to China and your Administration has taken significant action in this regard, including the China tires 421 safeguard action, as well as WTO disputes against China regarding raw materials, financial services and steel products. It is now time to redouble these efforts in two respects -- to take action on the basis of the Steelworkers' Section 301 petition and to ensure that USTR has the resources and personnel it needs to target these practices aggressively and comprehensively.As you know, the Steelworkers' Section 301 petition describes over 80 Chinese laws, regulations and practices that cover a broad spectrum of green technologies, including -- solar, wind, biomass, geothermal, hydropower, nuclear, and advanced batteries -- which seek to benefit Chinese manufacturers to the detriment of their American competitors.If left unchecked, these practices will achieve their intended effect, which is to drive American manufacturers from this critical emerging sector. While USTR will need to evaluate each aspect of the petition on its merits, we call on USTR to do so with a view to examining all appropriate responses that will quickly end these unfair trade practices.In addition, we urge you to redirect existing resources and dedicate significant new resources to the China trade enforcement mission of the United States government. USTR should build on existing capacities and expand to include additional personnel with linguistic, legal, investigative, trade and country expertise to target China's increasingly sophisticated unfair trade practices.Specifically, a dedicated China trade enforcement team should be tasked with translating relevant laws and regulations, investigating possible unfair trade practices, going to China to assist in case development, evaluating possible legal claims, and responding expeditiously with targeted action, including WTO dispute settlement where appropriate. This team should be led by USTR's Office of the General Counsel, and work closely with USTR's Chief Counsel for China Trade Enforcement and USTR's China Affairs Office, as well as other relevant offices within USTR and other agencies.We look forward to working with you and to doing our part to address these concerns in order to ensure that the United States is not denied the ability to fully compete in the green technology revolution.Sincerely,Sander M.

0,Mark Schauer,"On Friday, September 17, the U.S. Department of Transportation's Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) issued an amended Corrective Action Order (CAO) to Enbridge regarding Line 6B, the oil pipeline that caused the spill in Marshall, MI, in July. It amends the CAO issued on July 28, and stipulates additional requirements Enbridge must meet to ensure the safety and efficacy of the line. Congressman Mark Schauer (D-MI) issued the following response:""I am pleased to see the Department of Transportation getting tough on Enbridge and forcing them to make repairs I have requested to Line 6B that will improve the safety of the line and help prevent future incidents like the spill in Marshall,"" said Schauer. ""Setting hard deadlines for repairs, requiring additional assessments of the line within 14 days of restart, and hiring Oak Ridge National Laboratories as a third-party monitor during the restart process are all steps in the right direction toward protecting the health and safety of our communities. I plan to follow this process through to completion, holding both Enbridge and PHMSA to the highest possible standards.""The amended CAO includes all requirements specified in the original CAO, but lists a series of additional corrective actions that must also be taken by Enbridge before Line 6B can be restarted. They include:·Project plans and a schedule for the total replacement of the pipe in the entire St. Clair River crossing within one year of restart·Specific deadlines for repairs to every remaining defect in the line that meets repair criteria·At least two assessments of the entire line within 14 days of any restart·Oversight by a third-party monitor during the restart process·Aggressive action to repair any newly identified defects",Schauer Responds to PHMSA's Amended Corrective Action Order to Enbridge
0,Mark Schauer,"At today's first meeting of the President's Export Council, Congressman Mark Schauer (D-MI) spoke out against the panel's push to sign more free trade agreements with South Korea, Colombia and Panama, which would make it easier to ship American jobs overseas. Schauer joined several colleagues, including U.S. Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI), in signing a letter of dissent to oppose these unfair trade agreements.""To get our economy back on track, we need to export American products instead of American jobs,"" said Schauer. ""We've already lost millions of good-paying jobs due to unfair trade with China and Mexico, and signing more unfair trade deals with countries like South Korea, Colombia and Panama would only make things worse. Our businesses can compete with anyone, but we need to give them a level playing to create jobs here for American workers.""According to the nonpartisan Economic Policy Institute, Michigan has lost 68,300 jobs due to unfair trade with China since it joined the World Trade Organization in 2001. Similarly, Michigan lost 63,148 jobs due to NAFTA between 1993-2006, the third highest number in the nation. [EPI, 3/23/10; EPI, 9/28/06]The President's Export Council (PEC) is the principal national advisory committee on international trade. Schauer was appointed to serve on the panel earlier this year. The Council advises the President of government policies and programs that affect U.S. trade performance; promotes export expansion; and provides a forum for discussing and resolving trade-related problems among the business, industrial, agricultural, labor, and government sectors.A copy of the letter Congressman Schauer signed is available below:Dear Mr. President:We applaud your announcement of the formation of the President's Export Council(PEC) in July. Likewise, we are committed to working with you to develop a plan to help achieve the National Export Initiative's (NEI) goal of doubling U.S. exports over the next five years. The NEI is an ambitious challenge and by taking a collaborative, public-private approach to achieving the NEI's goals, we can make significant progress in strengthening our country's economy and creating millions of new jobs for American workers.While we also agree that negotiating bilateral, regional, and multilateral trade agreements can assist in achieving the NEI's objectives, we believe that such agreements will not improve the U.S. economy or reduce our trade deficit until we improve certain aspects of the pending agreements and strongly enforce existing agreements. Accordingly, we write to express our disagreement with the recommendations made in the letter from PEC Chairman James McNerny to move forward quickly on the pending free trade agreements with South Korea, Colombia, and Panama.At a time when our economy is struggling to recover from the worst downturn since the Great Depression, we caution against advancing these agreements without significant changes. A vital component of an export and jobs creation strategy is a trade agenda that does not repeat the mistakes of the previous administration. We need to increase market access to US goods so that we are exporting products, not jobs. At the same time, we must make sure that trade agreements have strong enforcement provisions that target the most pressing barriers facing American workers and businesses. Specifically, these agreements must be improved to promote robust, attainable labor and environmental standards; make the investment chapter, including the investor-state dispute settlement mechanism, more equitable; and enhance existing provisions on import safety and government procurement.We recognize, as you do, that done right, trade agreements can create jobs if they increase exports and help our economy recover. Done wrong, however, trade agreements send those same jobs off-shore, benefiting a narrow class of investors while leaving middle class American families behind. As members of your Export Council, we are eager to work with you to address these issues and to move forward with trade policies that reflect the changing needs of Main Street and the new realities of the global economy. We appreciate your consideration of our supplemental views.Sincerely,Representative Linda Sanchez (D-CA)Senator Debbie Stabenow (D-MI)Representative Mark Schauer (D-MI)Senator Sherrod Brown (D-OH)Representative David Wu (D-OR)",Schauer Fights Free Trade Agenda at Meeting of President's Export Council
0,Mark Schauer,"Mr Chairman and Ranking Member Shuster,On Monday, July 26 at approximately 1:30 p.m., I was boarding a flight fromDetroit to Washington for votes in the House of Representatives that evening.It was at almost that exact time that a company few in Calhoun County, Michigan, had ever heard of -- Enbridge Energy Partners -- reported an oil spill to the National Response Center into Talmadge Creek, just south of the city of Marshall.Starting about 9:30 p.m. the night before, on Sunday, July 25, residents in the Talmadge Creek area began calling 911, complaining of a gas odor.As we'll learn here today, this was just after a shift change in the Enbridge control room in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada -- the same control room that experienced 13 hours of alarms telling them that something was going on in Line 6B of Enbridge's Lakehead Pipeline.After a brief meeting with the President -- in which he committed all necessaryresources to deal with the largest oil spill ever in the Midwest -- I flew home to see for myself.Jill Slaght of my staff, a Marshall resident, was there on the job and my team and I have had our sleeves rolled up and have been working to help affected people ever since.I saw the unimaginable. My community lost its innocence that night and insubsequent days. One million gallons of heavy crude oil poured into TalmadgeCreek and then into the Kalamazoo River, a tributary to Lake Michigan.I never would have imagined that just after holding hearings on the BP DeepWater Horizon spill and strengthening the Oil Pollution Act, my community would be dealing with images of oil-coated geese and a river flowing black with oil.The ironies are too many to cite. Just 10 days before, an executive of Enbridge Energy Partners testified before this very committee on its integrity management system and stated that its control room could detect the smallest of leaks. As we learned, it failed. Also on that day, July 15, 2010, Enbridge requested to the Pipelines and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration that it be allowed to operate Line 6B at reduced pressure for another two and a half years while it considered repairs to identified defects to this pipeline. And this is on top of the one year that Enbridge had already been operating under reduced pressure while it considered what to do about known defects in its pipeline.As a result of in-line inspections since 2007, Enbridge knew of 390 defects but only saw fit to repair 61 of them -- leaving 329 unrepaired.The section of pipeline that ruptured wasn't even one of these. I learned fromdocumentation provided by Enbridge to PHMSA two weeks ago that the section of pipeline that tore had a defect, but the defect didn't reach PHMSA's threshold requiring repair.But isn't it Enbridge's responsibility to make sure that its pipeline is safe and that people won't be injured and the environment won't be impacted?Enbridge has a lot of experience in this area -- with 163 pipeline spills since 2002, 83 of them on the Lakehead System.Mr. Chairman, thank you for holding this hearing today. It's important to thepeople in Michigan, where 286 miles of this pipeline lay.This hearing is ultimately about people -- people whose lives have been changed, for some, permanently and irrevocably. We hold this hearing for Mitchell Price who couldn't be here but who wrote to me about his property along the Kalamazoo River that's been spoiled. And it's for Bobbie and Burita Lewis who feel violated and whose lives have been turned upside down.This is also a hearing about safety.Our current laws and regulations are not working, as we have seen with this spill and others.The Enbridge pipeline spill is just one example of the need for further corporate responsibility and public oversight. There were three other incidents just in the past week, two from Enbridge lines.Public health was compromised by Enbridge's spill, with over 60 homes beingevacuated. Area medical centers have reported over 120 visits related to illnesses from the oil spill.Over 1,000 oiled wildlife have been collected thus far. And the spill area is stilltoday under advisories for drinking water, recreation, and fish consumption.We do not yet know what the long term impacts of this spill will be on the health, safety, environment, and economy of these communities in my district. According to the National Institute of Health, there has never been a study of what the effects are of the high exposure levels of benzene and related odors, like the levels we saw in this spill, to children and infants. The testing has only been done in adults.Additionally, I am very concerned before this pipeline is restarted that it canoperate safely. Given the recent releases in New York and Illinois, and the over 80 release incidents reported by Enbridge since 2002, I do not think it can.Every inch of this pipeline should be inspected and every defect fixed before eight million gallons per day of heavy crude oil begins to flow through it again.From the very beginning there have been questions surrounding when thisrupture and oil spill occurred.Again, Enbridge stated in testimony to our committee's Subcommittee onRailroads, Pipelines, and Hazardous Materials on July 15, 2010 that their response time for release incidents ""can be almost instantaneous, and our large peaks are typically detected by our control center personnel.""I am concerned about Enbridge's statement to the committee about theirequipment and personnel being able to detect leaks almost instantaneouslyespecially after this spill.Enbridge's control room in Alberta started experiencing alarms the day before the spill was reported to federal officials at 5:58 p.m. on the 6B line. Additionally, reports of odors started coming into local emergency officials on that evening at 9:26 p.m.At 11:18 a.m. on July 26th, Consumers Energy reported to Enbridge that there was oil in the Talmadge Creek. The leak was confirmed by Enbridge personnel at 11:45 a.m. and they reported the spill to the National Response Center at 1:29 p.m., nearly two hours after confirmed discovery by their personnel.Thirteen hours of alarms in their control center in Alberta, and they still wereunable to discover and report the leak near Talmadge Creek in their pipeline.Current regulation requires pipeline operators to report incidents immediatelyupon discovery of a release. In 2002, PHMSA determined ""immediately"" to bedefined as between one and two hours of discovery. Enbridge documentationindicates that reporting must be provided within two hours of discovery.I introduced the Corporate Liability and Emergency Accident Notification Act (the CLEAN Act) to clarify the term ""immediately"" in the reporting requirements of a spill incident to the National Response Center to be no more than one hour after the discovery of an incident. My bill will also increase the current fines if a spill is not reported ""immediately"" to the National Response Center. It should not take more than an hour to report a spill release after it has been confirmed. In an accident like this with people and the environment at risk, every second counts.Mr. Chairman, under current regulations, railroad employees can lose theirlicense to operate a train for exceeding the speed limit by ten miles per hour,failing to make a brake test, or occupying a main track without permission. Truck drivers can lose their commercial drivers license for speeding, making an erratic lane change, following another vehicle too closely or even bottoming out the undercarriage at a highway-rail grade crossing. Those are serious offenses -- don't get me wrong -- but a company that has the longest petroleum pipeline in the world can spill one million gallons of crude oil, devastating a local community and sensitive environmental areas, and they do not have to fix all the anomalies in their pipeline? That concerns me to no end.My concerns do not only extend to Enbridge's pipeline safety practices but also the company's practices with the spill claims process and labor practices at the oil spill clean-up site.I have heard from citizens who were asked to sign waivers releasing Enbridge from any other liability in exchange for an air purifier -- that, by the way, offers no protection from benzene.Enbridge also had citizens sign waivers releasing all of their medical history to the company in return for medical treatment. This is outrageous and is a clear HIPAA violation. People should not have to sign away their rights to receive medical treatment or be reimbursed for a legitimate claim.I also heard numerous concerns from community members whose businesseshave been negatively impacted by the spill. Some citizens reported banksredlining people from buying their homes because it was in the vicinity of the oil spill. And numerous citizens are still concerned with the short-and long-term health impacts from the spill.Additionally, there have been news reports of labor and worker safety issues with one of Enbridge's contractors, Hallmark Industrial LLC. One newspaper article reported Hallmark Industrial using illegal, undocumented workers to help work on the spill clean-up site. The article also reports that there were unsafe working conditions and workers who were not qualified with the proper certifications working on the spill clean-up.This goes beyond media reports. Illegal workers bused in by an Enbridgesubcontractor from Texas were actually arrested upon return to Texas.This is wrong and illegal. There are many qualified workers in my district that would love to have the opportunity to work on the oil spill clean-up. As a result of this article, Chairman Oberstar and I have asked for an investigation surrounding the labor, immigration, and safety issues involving Enbridge and Hallmark Industrial.Just a few days ago, the same newspaper reported Enbridge was notified onAugust 23rd about the issues surrounding one of their contractors. Interestingly, Enbridge's spokesperson said that they examine the documents of all workers. We need to look closely at all of the issues in regard to Enbridge's business practices and the oil spill.Mr. Chairman, today we will hear from citizens in my district on how this spill has impacted their families, businesses, and daily lives and how, up until they were on the list to testify here today, Enbridge denied some or all of their claims for restitution. Enbridge has offered most of the witnesses here settlements over the last 72 hours. Mr. Chairman, perhaps we should hold three additional hearings so the other citizens from my district impacted in this spill that have been denied claims by Enbridge will too be able to get the damage reimbursement they deserve.The citizens in my district deserve to be treated fairly by the company and to be reimbursed for all of the damages they have already incurred and will continue to incur in the future.They deserve to have Enbridge held accountable for this oil spill and the safety of this pipeline.Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for holding this important hearing and allowing thecitizens of my district to be able to voice their concerns. I would like to thank all of the people from my district for taking the time out of their busy schedules to come and testify today before our committee.","Hearing of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee - ""Enbridge Pipeline Oil Spill in Marshall, Michigan"""
0,Mark Schauer,"Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member Shuster,On Monday, July 26 at approximately 1:30 p.m., I was boarding a flight from Detroit to Washington for votes in the House of Representatives that evening.It was at almost that exact time that a company few in Calhoun County, Michigan, had ever heard of -- Enbridge Energy Partners -- reported an oil spill to the National Response Center into Talmadge Creek, just south of the city of Marshall.Starting about 9:30 p.m. the night before, on Sunday, July 25, residents in the Talmadge Creek area began calling 911, complaining of a gas odor.As we'll learn here today, this was just after a shift change in the Enbridge control room in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada -- the same control room that experienced 13 hours of alarms telling them that something was going on in Line 6B of Enbridge's Lakehead Pipeline.After a brief meeting with the President -- in which he committed all necessary resources to deal with the largest oil spill ever in the Midwest -- I flew home to see for myself.Jill Slaght of my staff, a Marshall resident, was there on the job and my team and I have had our sleeves rolled up and have been working to help affected people ever since.I saw the unimaginable. My community lost its innocence that night and in subsequent days. One million gallons of heavy crude oil poured into Talmadge Creek and then into the Kalamazoo River, a tributary to Lake Michigan.I never would have imagined that just after holding hearings on the BP Deep Water Horizon spill and strengthening the Oil Pollution Act, my community would be dealing with images of oil-coated geese and a river flowing black with oil.The ironies are too many to cite. Just 10 days before, an executive of Enbridge Energy Partners testified before this very committee on its integrity management system and stated that its control room could detect the smallest of leaks. As we learned, it failed. Also on that day, July 15, 2010, Enbridge requested to the Pipelines and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration that it be allowed to operate Line 6B at reduced pressure for another two and a half years while it considered repairs to identified defects to this pipeline. And this is on top of the one year that Enbridge had already been operating under reduced pressure while it considered what to do about known defects in its pipeline.As a result of in-line inspections since 2007, Enbridge knew of 390 defects but only saw fit to repair 61 of them -- leaving 329 unrepaired.The section of pipeline that ruptured wasn't even one of these. I learned from documentation provided by Enbridge to PHMSA two weeks ago that the section of pipeline that tore had a defect, but the defect didn't reach PHMSA's threshold requiring repair.But isn't it Enbridge's responsibility to make sure that its pipeline is safe and that people won't be injured and the environment won't be impacted?Enbridge has a lot of experience in this area -- with 163 pipeline spills since 2002, 83 of them on the Lakehead System.Mr. Chairman, thank you for holding this hearing today. It's important to the people in Michigan, where 286 miles of this pipeline lay.This hearing is ultimately about people -- people whose lives have been changed, for some, permanently and irrevocably. We hold this hearing for Mitchell Price who couldn't be here but who wrote to me about his property along the Kalamazoo River that's been spoiled. And it's for Bobbie and Burita Lewis who feel violated and whose lives have been turned upside down.This is also a hearing about safety.Our current laws and regulations are not working, as we have seen with this spill and others.The Enbridge pipeline spill is just one example of the need for further corporate responsibility and public oversight. There were three other incidents just in the past week, two from Enbridge lines.Public health was compromised by Enbridge's spill, with over 60 homes being evacuated. Area medical centers have reported over 120 visits related to illnesses from the oil spill.Over 1,000 oiled wildlife have been collected thus far. And the spill area is still today under advisories for drinking water, recreation, and fish consumption.We do not yet know what the long term impacts of this spill will be on the health, safety, environment, and economy of these communities in my district. According to the National Institute of Health, there has never been a study of what the effects are of the high exposure levels of benzene and related odors, like the levels we saw in this spill, to children and infants. The testing has only been done in adults.Additionally, I am very concerned before this pipeline is restarted that it can operate safely. Given the recent releases in New York and Illinois, and the over 80 release incidents reported by Enbridge since 2002, I do not think it can.Every inch of this pipeline should be inspected and every defect fixed before eight million gallons per day of heavy crude oil begins to flow through it again.From the very beginning there have been questions surrounding when this rupture and oil spill occurred.Again, Enbridge stated in testimony to our committee's Subcommittee on Railroads, Pipelines, and Hazardous Materials on July 15, 2010 that their response time for release incidents ""can be almost instantaneous, and our large peaks are typically detected by our control center personnel.""I am concerned about Enbridge's statement to the committee about their equipment and personnel being able to detect leaks almost instantaneously especially after this spill.Enbridge's control room in Alberta started experiencing alarms the day before the spill was reported to federal officials at 5:58 p.m. on the 6B line. Additionally, reports of odors started coming into local emergency officials on that evening at 9:26 p.m.At 11:18 a.m. on July 26th, Consumers Energy reported to Enbridge that there was oil in the Talmadge Creek. The leak was confirmed by Enbridge personnel at 11:45 a.m. and they reported the spill to the National Response Center at 1:29 p.m., nearly two hours after confirmed discovery by their personnel.Thirteen hours of alarms in their control center in Alberta, and they still were unable to discover and report the leak near Talmadge Creek in their pipeline.Current regulation requires pipeline operators to report incidents immediately upon discovery of a release. In 2002, PHMSA determined ""immediately"" to be defined as between one and two hours of discovery. Enbridge documentation indicates that reporting must be provided within two hours of discovery.I introduced the Corporate Liability and Emergency Accident Notification Act (the CLEAN Act) to clarify the term ""immediately"" in the reporting requirements of a spill incident to the National Response Center to be no more than one hour after the discovery of an incident. My bill will also increase the current fines if a spill is not reported ""immediately"" to the National Response Center. It should not take more than an hour to report a spill release after it has been confirmed. In an accident like this with people and the environment at risk, every second counts.Mr. Chairman, under current regulations, railroad employees can lose their license to operate a train for exceeding the speed limit by ten miles per hour, failing to make a brake test, or occupying a main track without permission. Truck drivers can lose their commercial drivers license for speeding, making an erratic lane change, following another vehicle too closely or even bottoming out the undercarriage at a highway-rail grade crossing. Those are serious offenses -- don't get me wrong -- but a company that has the longest petroleum pipeline in the world can spill one million gallons of crude oil, devastating a local community and sensitive environmental areas, and they do not have to fix all the anomalies in their pipeline? That concerns me to no end.My concerns do not only extend to Enbridge's pipeline safety practices but also the company's practices with the spill claims process and labor practices at the oil spill clean-up site.I have heard from citizens who were asked to sign waivers releasing Enbridge from any other liability in exchange for an air purifier -- that, by the way, offers no protection from benzene.Enbridge also had citizens sign waivers releasing all of their medical history to the company in return for medical treatment. This is outrageous and is a clear HIPAA violation. People should not have to sign away their rights to receive medical treatment or be reimbursed for a legitimate claim.I also heard numerous concerns from community members whose businesses have been negatively impacted by the spill. Some citizens reported banks redlining people from buying their homes because it was in the vicinity of the oil spill. And numerous citizens are still concerned with the short-and long-term health impacts from the spill.Additionally, there have been news reports of labor and worker safety issues with one of Enbridge's contractors, Hallmark Industrial LLC. One newspaper article reported Hallmark Industrial using illegal, undocumented workers to help work on the spill clean-up site. The article also reports that there were unsafe working conditions and workers who were not qualified with the proper certifications working on the spill clean-up.This goes beyond media reports. Illegal workers bused in by an Enbridge subcontractor from Texas were actually arrested upon return to Texas.This is wrong and illegal. There are many qualified workers in my district that would love to have the opportunity to work on the oil spill clean-up. As a result of this article, Chairman Oberstar and I have asked for an investigation surrounding the labor, immigration, and safety issues involving Enbridge and Hallmark Industrial.Just a few days ago, the same newspaper reported Enbridge was notified on August 23rd about the issues surrounding one of their contractors. Interestingly, Enbridge's spokesperson said that they examine the documents of all workers.We need to look closely at all of the issues in regard to Enbridge's business practices and the oil spill.Mr. Chairman, today we will hear from citizens in my district on how this spill has impacted their families, businesses, and daily lives and how, up until they were on the list to testify here today, Enbridge denied some or all of their claims for restitution. Enbridge has offered most of the witnesses here settlements over the last 72 hours. Mr. Chairman, perhaps we should hold three additional hearings so the other citizens from my district impacted in this spill that have been denied claims by Enbridge will too be able to get the damage reimbursement they deserve.The citizens in my district deserve to be treated fairly by the company and to be reimbursed for all of the damages they have already incurred and will continue to incur in the future.They deserve to have Enbridge held accountable for this oil spill and the safety of this pipeline.Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for holding this important hearing and allowing the citizens of my district to be able to voice their concerns. I would like to thank all of the people from my district for taking the time out of their busy schedules to come and testify today before our committee.Footage from the hearing will be archived at http://transportation.house.gov",Congressman Schauer's Opening Remarks at Congressional Hearing on the Enbridge Oil Spill
0,Mark Schauer,"Upon hearing about the Enbridge oil spill in Romeoville, IL, Congressman Mark Schauer (D-MI) issued the following statement:""This most recent spill by Enbridge along Line 6A in Illinois left me stunned, but not entirely surprised,"" said Schauer. ""It once again demonstrates the company's apparent inability to safely operate their pipeline system. It is a reminder of the urgency of fixing all defects in Line 6B, the line that ruptured in Michigan, before it can be restarted. The health and safety of those living near the pipeline system cannot be compromised.""",Schauer Comments on Enbridge Spill in Illinois
0,Mark Schauer,"Today Congressman Mark Schauer (D-MI) and Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Chairman James L. Oberstar (D-MN) called for an investigation on the state and federal level of the way Enbridge is handling damage claims by spill victims. The Committee has discovered evidence that Enbridge is asking residents to waive legal rights to seek further compensation in exchange for small cash disbursements or items such as air purifiers. The Committee also found that those seeking medical treatment for health problems related to the spill have been pressured to sign over medical records to the oil company.Oberstar and Schauer sent letters to the Department of Justice, the Department of Health and Human Services, and Enbridge in an effort to stem the practice. Schauer also sent a letter to Michigan Attorney General Mike Cox.""Enbridge's efforts to take legal advantage of Michigan residents under the stress of the immediate aftermath of the worst oil spill in the region's history are reprehensible,"" Oberstar and Schauer wrote in their letter to the company. ""We are outraged that Enbridge would convince or seek to convince residents, workers, and business owners to sign release forms, which attempt to release Enbridge of all liability from claims -- in some cases in exchange for an air purifier. We are equally distressed that Enbridge would convince or seek to convince residents with health effects from the oil spill to release all medical records and provide Enbridge with authority to discuss signatories' medical and psychological condition and treatment directly with residents' doctors.""The Committee investigation found that Enbridge has convinced, or is seeking to convince, residents, workers, and business owners in the areas impacted by the spill to sign a ""Full and Final Settlement Release"". The release ""discharges Enbridge, its employees, agents, partners, directors, and officers and affiliated companies and their agents, partners, directors, and officers, from and against all liability, claims, actions, causes of action, costs, and expenses, including without limitation claims for personal injuries, property damage, that [the signer] ever had, has, or may have against Enbridge, whether known or unknown related to the incident.""Many residents told the Committee staff that they felt pressured to sign the Enbridge liability release in return for air purifiers that they were led to believe would protect them from the health effects of Benzene and other volatile hydrocarbons released in the air as a result of the spill, or reimbursement for hotel and other expenses as a result of the evacuation. Other residents were urged to sign the release upon submittal of their claim forms to Enbridge at the claims centers. Many residents have reported to the Committee that they had no idea what they were signing.The Committee will hold a hearing on the Enbridge spill in Washington on September 15, 2010. The letters sent by Schauer and Oberstar are attached.","Schauer, Oberstar Call for Investigation into Enbridge Claims Practices"

""Our community repeatedly asked the EPA and Enbridge to use local labor, and the fact that Enbridge allowed one of its contractors to hire illegal immigrants is appalling.""The story on the arrest can be found here: http://setxhomepage.com/fulltext?nxd_id=113745",Schauer comments on illegal Enbridge subcontractors arrested in Texas
0,Mark Schauer,"Today Congressman Mark Schauer (D-MI) released letters sent to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) calling for an investigation of allegations of undocumented workers being used to clean up the Enbridge oil spill. Schauer issued the following statement regarding the situation:""It's outrageous that Enbridge allowed undocumented workers to be hired to clean up the spill, showing complete disregard for our country's labor laws. That's why I called on federal agencies to conduct an investigation and hold responsible parties accountable for their actions,"" said Schauer.""This situation should not have happened, and it is particularly troubling given the high unemployment rate in our state and the availability of HAZMAT-trained workers right here in Calhoun County that could be hired for these jobs,"" said Schauer. ""Our workers have been turned away as undocumented workers were brought in on buses from Texas. Prior to these allegations, our community repeatedly asked the EPA and Enbridge to use local labor, and have been rebuffed in our efforts. Is this what Enbridge meant when they said they'd ""make it right'?""August 31, 2010The Honorable Lisa P. JacksonAdministratorU.S. Environmental Protection Agency1200 Pennsylvania Ave., NWWashington, DC 20460Dear Administrator Jackson:It has been brought to my attention that Hallmark Industrial, LLC, a Texas-based oil spill cleanup contractor, may have hired hundreds of undocumented workers to assist EPA-led cleanup efforts in connection with the July 26, 2010 Enbridge oil pipeline rupture near Marshall, Michigan. IN addition, sources indicate that site supervisors consistently ignore basic work-safety requirements and expose workers to extremely hazardous substances without proper safety precautions. I am aware that this is not the first time Hallmark Industrial, LLC, has come under scrutiny regarding possible immigration violations, and am concerned about the level of knowledge Enbridge had in employing these workers, and how the EPA in managing the cleanup was not positioned to keep this from happening.At a time when unemployment in Calhoun County is over 13%, and national unemployment hovers over 10%, I am outraged at the lack of oversight that could lead to a government-led cleanup effort employing workers without documentation and without certification to safely complete this work. The spill is the largest oil spill ever to strike the Midwest. Certainly, with a spill this large, it could have been anticipated that hundreds of workers would be needed to address this spill. While I hoped that this problem could have been avoided, I ask that you take all necessary steps to remedy this situation.To that end, I request that the Environmental Protection Agency, Department of Labor, Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement Bureau launch an immediate investigation to ensure that those responsible are held accountable, and that measures are taken to ensure that this never happens again. Further, I ask you to investigate whether Enbridge turned a blind eye or should have known that Hallmark was employing workers without documentation or certification.Lastly, I ask that you investigate the full range of compliance issues implicated by these accusations, including visa status, reporting procedures, document of status, posting requirements, and tax reporting and compliance.Enclosed you will find a news article from the Michigan Messenger that I believe will assist with your investigation.If you have any questions, please contact my Chief of Staff, Ken Brock in my Jackson, Michigan District Office at (517) 780-9075.

Eight months ago they said they would allow American cars to participate in their cash for clunkers program but have rigged the rules so that few can,"" said Representative Peters.

At that time, government policies designed to implement Japan's vehicle scrappage program had classified all U.S.-based automaker vehicles exported to Japan as ineligible.We were pleased when the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry announced on January 19 that the Japanese scrappage program would include opportunities for vehicles imported using the Preferential Handling Procedure (PHP) import certification process to qualify, thereby allowing vehicles produced by U.S.-based automakers to participate. This announcement suggested that Japan's program would be more inclusive, as the U.S. program that Congress enacted in 2009 was. The open, inclusive, and transparent U.S. program developed and approved by Congress specifically allowed all global automakers to have vehicles eligible for vehicle purchases incentives, including Japanese automakers, so as to comply with international trade rules.Despite the announcement that Japan's program would be open to U.S.-based automakers, Japan subsequently released a severely limited list of U.S. auto models that qualify for its program. Many of us wrote Ambassador Fujisaki on February 23, 2010 regarding Japan's decision to use EPA ""city"" mileage ratings instead of EPA ""combined city/highway"" mileage ratings as the basis for determining eligibility of vehicles imported using the PHP process. We write today to express our disappointment that this policy still stands. Using ""city"" mileage ratings does not provide an accurate efficiency evaluation of U.S. vehicles, and this serves to significantly limit the eligibility of U.S. auto models for the Eco-friendly Vehicle Purchase Program. This is not in keeping with Japan's earlier announcement that this program would be inclusive and non-discriminatory.We ask you to reconsider the decision to use EPA ""city"" mileage ratings, as the ""combined city/highway"" mileage ratings better reflect the overall mileage performance of U.S. automobiles. We hope that you will reverse this decision, and implement the Eco-friendly Vehicle Purchase Program, and any future scrappage programs, in a transparent manner that is fair to U.S. autos and complies with international trade rules. We urge you to take this important step towards opening the Japanese market and allowing broader market access for U.S. vehicles. Our nation's open-market, free-trade policies and practices must have reciprocal application with our key global trading partners.In coordination with the Obama Administration and U.S. Industry, we will continue to closely monitor developments in the Japanese Eco-friendly Automobile Purchase Program to ensure that U.S. companies are actually benefitting from the program.

The letters sent detailed a series of actions to be taken, in addition to requirements outlined in an earlier Corrective Action Order (CAO), that would protect citizens in the state of Michigan who live near the line.The CAO issued by PHMSA against Enbridge on July 28, 2010 ensures that Line 6B does not return to full service until Enbridge meets all safety requirements and testing in a manner acceptable to PHMSA.;The rejection letter outlines a number of requirements imposed by PHMSA. In light of new information obtained by PHMSA investigators since issuing the CAO, PHMSA is requiring Enbridge to identify additional areas of concern on the pipeline for excavation, inspection and repair. Enbridge must also conduct more extensive testing of Line 6B and address control room and leak detection improvements to the satisfaction of PHMSA. Enbridge must now submit a revised proposal addressing PHMSA's safety concerns.","Schauer: PHMSA Rejection of Enbridge Restart Plan ""Good First Step"""

I insist that Mr. Daniel and the DOT take appropriate actions to inform and protect the people who live near the line, and wait to restart the flow of oil until every possible precaution has been taken.""In the letters, Schauer requested the following in addition to the CAO:* The restart plan submitted by Enbridge for review and approval by the U.S. Department of Transportation Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) will be made available to the public, which will be provided a reasonable amount of time to review the plan;* A public meeting will be held in the area impacted by the rupture, at which time Enbridge will describe the plan and the public will be provided the opportunity to comment on the plan and ask any questions of Enbridge and Federal safety regulators;* Enbridge will conduct a full integrity management assessment of the condition of the entire Line 6B pipeline, not just the ruptured section;* Enbridge will repair (or replace, as appropriate) all anomalies identified by the assessment described above, as well as all of the anomalies identified in the assessments conducted by your company in 2007 and 2009 which still are yet to be repaired;* Enbridge will provide details (in writing) on the locations of any identified anomalies, the cause(s) of those anomalies, and any repairs/replacements made to PHMSA.In addition, Schauer has asked PHMSA, at a minimum, to: (1) conduct a thorough inspection of the pipeline and related Enbridge assets, and verify the results of the assessment(s) described above and that all repairs or replacements were, in fact, made by Enbridge; (2) verify that corrosion control monitoring and leak detection equipment are operating on the line and are sufficient to detect corrosion or any leaks that may occur in the future; and (3) verify that Enbridge's control center and leak detection systems are adequate to instantaneously detect a leak of any size and that its response plans are adequate to protect the public safety and avoid environmental impacts.","Schauer Calls on U.S. DOT, Enbridge to Assure Safety of Pipeline Before Restarting"
0,Mark Schauer,"Today Congressman Mark Schauer (D-MI) announced that the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee will be launching a formal investigation into the Enbridge oil spill. After discussing the leak with subcommittee leaders yesterday, Chairwoman Corrine Brown (D-FL) and Vice Chairman Tim Walz (D-MN) agreed to conduct hearings when Congress returns in September. The investigation will be conducted by the Subcommittee on Railroads, Pipelines, and Hazardous Materials. Schauer is a member of the panel, which oversees the nation's network of oil and gas pipelines.""Enbridge needs to answer some tough questions about how this happened, and I plan to hold them fully accountable,"" said Schauer. ""Moreover, we need to learn why the federal agency that oversees oil pipelines failed to notify Congress about its concerns related to corrosion on Enbridge's Lakehead System. The company's failure to report the incident in a timely manner put public safety at risk, and we need to make sure something like this doesn't happen again.""Earlier this week, Schauer introduced the bipartisan Corporate Liability and Emergency Accident Notification (CLEAN) Act (HR 6008) to improve response times to pipeline disasters, limit the time a company has to report an incident to the National Response Center, and increase fines for failure to notify the NRC within that time limit. The bill now has 12 cosponsors, including U.S. Reps. Fred Upton (R-MI), Vern Ehlers (R-MI) and Candice Miller (R-MI), and has been referred to the Transportation and Infrastructure and Energy and Commerce Committees.",Schauer Announces Congressional Investigation into Enbridge Oil Spill

""There is no excuse for the amount of time that lapsed between when Enbridge discovered the leak and when they reported it. We need to hold companies like Enbridge accountable for their inaction and make sure there's no delay in future responses to these types of disasters.""Schauer noted that Enbridge isn't living up to the testimony it provided to Congress just two weeks ago, when Richard Adams testified that, ""safety and protection of the public and environment are our highest priorities, indeed we hold this as a core value.""* Schauer is a member of the Subcommittee on Railroads, Pipelines, and Hazardous Materials where Adams testified.Current law states that companies must report an incident ""immediately,"" which is defined in regulation as the ""earliest practicable moment."" Schauer's CLEAN Act would retain the ""immediate"" requirement, but create an outside cap of one hour after the discovery of a leak. Companies that fail to notify immediately or exceed the one-hour requirement would face a penalty of $250,000, up from the previous $100,000, and penalties would increase to $2.5 million for companies having multiple related violations.The bill would also create a public, searchable internet database of all reportable incidents involving gas or hazardous liquid pipelines, increasing transparency and holding oil companies accountable for the damage they cause.*[Testimony of Richard Adams, Enbridge Energy Vice President of US operations, July 15, 2010, US House Subcommittee on Railroads, Pipelines, and Hazardous Materials.]","Schauer Introduces Legislation to Improve Disaster Response Times, Hold Oil Company Accountable"

He is the Nigerian man accused of trying to ignite a bomb onboard a flight bound for Detroit last Christmas. Concerned about both the security preparations and the cost of the Abdulmutallab trial, the Members sent a letter to Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano this week. The Members made the following comments about the Department's handling of this matter so far:Senator Carl Levin (D): ""Michigan is ready to do its part in contributing to our national security. Our letter is intended to ensure that Michigan gets the support it needs to carry out its responsibilities with respect to this trial, and to ensure that DHS has a plan in place to provide that support.""Senator Debbie Stabenow (D): ""This trial has both national and global implications, and the Department of Homeland Security should provide the resources necessary to protect the people of Detroit and Southeast Michigan.""Congressman Pete Hoekstra (R-MI02): ""Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab is a terrorist who attempted to blow up a flight as it landed in Detroit, and he should be treated as such. He is not a civilian, he is an enemy combatant, and he should not be tried in a civilian court. However, if the Obama administration moves forward with a trial in Detroit, the federal government must provide the security and pay the costs necessary to ensure that Michigan residents are protected against threats and risks that may result from it.""Congressman Fred Upton (R-MI06) ""There is no question that the feds should handle a trial of this magnitude. Every resource must be made available in trying Abdulmutallab for his brazen act of terrorism against our nation. A trial in Michigan will put a tremendous burden on our resources, not to mention put a bullseye squarely on our backs for other possible attacks, creating a security nightmare. The federal government is best equipped with the resources and manpower to bring this terrorist to justice.""Congressman Mike Rogers (R-MI08): ""This is a foreign terrorist trained in a foreign land to kill hundreds of Americans. Michiganders know he should not be treated as a common criminal, but instead as an enemy combatant tried in a military tribunal. They surely know they shouldn't get stuck paying the bill for the security of holding a civilian trial of a terrorist in our community among our families.""Congressman Gary Peters (D-MI09): ""We want to know there is a solid plan in place for security and who is going to pay for it. That's not too much to ask. The Administration has sought to ensure that New York City would receive federal funding if a terror trial were held there, and there is no reason Detroit should not be offered the same.""Congresswoman Candice Miller (R-MI10): ""Since this failed terror attack, and subsequent flawed decision to try Abdulmutallab in Detroit, the people of Michigan have been asked to bear an undue burden for trying this terrorist in our court system in Michigan. The cost associated with this trial is the responsibility of the federal government, and I join with my colleagues from Michigan to ensure that our state does not pay further for being the target of this terrorist act.""Congressman Sander M. Levin (D-MI12): ""The people of Michigan deserve assurance that full security will be in place for the trial of the suspect in the attempted bombing of Northwest Flight 253, and a commitment from the federal government to bear the full cost of providing this security.""Congresswoman Carolyn Cheeks Kilpatrick (D- MI13)""As Michigan's sole member in Congress who has served on the House Appropriations Homeland Security Subcommittee, I understand and appreciate the importance of our nation's security and how it should be financed.

A recent article in the Detroit News has shed new light on the question of who will pay for security for the trial, and Representative Candice Miller (R-MI) sent a similar letter several months ago on this matter. The response received by Mrs. Miller was insufficient, so we write today as a delegation to ask for a more concrete and definitive answer.The safety of the citizens in Southeast Michigan is paramount and the Federal Government needs to be completely clear that if Mr. Abdulmutallab is tried at the Theodore Levin Courthouse in Detroit, the Federal Government has a plan to ensure security at the Courthouse and surrounding areas, and, further, that the Federal Government will bear the full cost of providing this security. We know you agree that Michigan residents' safety and security are as important as that of citizens of New York, where other trails for suspected terrorists are planned. If the Federal Government pays for security-related matters for the New York trials, it must be prepared to do the same in Detroit.In your Department's June 2, 2010 response to Representative Miller, you state that Detroit would be eligible for funds in the President's request of $200 million for the Urban Areas Security Initiative (UASI) to provide security for ""terror-related trials.""

The Korea FTA, as negotiated by President George W. Bush's administration, is another NAFTA-style free trade agreement that could exacerbate the U.S. trade deficit, hurt American manufacturers, and jeopardize the economic recovery.""Michigan has already lost countless jobs due to unfair trade agreements with China and Mexico, and passing another unfair trade deal with South Korea would only make things worse,"" said Schauer. ""We need fair trade policies that strengthen American manufacturing, protect American jobs, and lay the groundwork for long-term economic growth. While I am committed to boosting U.S. exports, simply passing a free trade agreement that was negotiated under the Bush administration would be a major step in the wrong direction.""Schauer and his colleagues explain in a letter to President Obama that, ""We oppose specific provisions of the agreement in the financial services, investment, and labor chapters, because they benefit multi-national corporations at the expense of small businesses and workers. And we strongly object to the non-tariff barriers to the Korean market that numerous U.S. industries -- including the auto, beef, and textile sectors -- will continue to face even as their Korean counterparts receive virtually total access to the American market.""Congressman Schauer was appointed to serve on the President's Export Council earlier this year. A copy of the letter Schauer signed is available below:July 23, 2010President Barack ObamaThe White House1600 Pennsylvania Ave, N.W.Washington, D.C. 20500Dear President Obama:We write today to request a meeting with you to discuss your plan to bring the Korea-U.S. Free Trade Agreement (FTA) to Congress for a vote next year. A meeting will allow us to discuss our specific concerns with you and to identify a way to unify the Democratic Party and all Americans on the issue of trade.The Korea FTA, as negotiated by President George W. Bush's administration, is another NAFTA-style FTA that we simply cannot support in its current form. We oppose specific provisions of the agreement in the financial services, investment, and labor chapters, because they benefit multi-national corporations at the expense of small businesses and workers. And we strongly object to the non-tariff barriers to the Korean market that numerous U.S. industries -- including the auto, beef, and textile sectors -- will continue to face even as their Korean counterparts receive virtually total access to the American market.At a time when our economy is struggling to recover from the worst downturn since the Great Depression, it is unthinkable to consider moving forward with another job-killing FTA. We recognize, as you do, that done right, trade agreements can create jobs as they increase exports and help our economy recover. But done wrong, trade agreements send those same jobs off-shore, benefitting a narrow class of investors while leaving average Americans worse off. Americans believe that more NAFTA-style agreements will derail, not promote, our economic recovery.Ratifying this pact without major changes to the text will exacerbate the U.S. trade deficit; further erode the U.S. manufacturing base; jeopardize our efforts to guard against another global economic meltdown; and make the U.S. government vulnerable to compensation demands in foreign tribunals raised by Korean companies doing business within our borders. Moreover, it is simply out of touch with what the overwhelming majority of American people want.We ask for this meeting to discuss with you specific proposals to improve the Korea FTA and the overall U.S. trade model. We must take advantage of this unique and historic opportunity to unite the Democratic Party and all Americans behind a new trade policy that benefits big and small companies and blue and white collar workers alike.Sincerely,","Letter to the Honorable Barack Obama, President of the United States"
0,Mark Schauer,"BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT.Mr. SCHAUER. Thank you, Mr. Perriello and Mr. Duncan.We need common sense in Washington, and unfortunately there is too little of it at this time. That's why I decided to sign on and be a primary cosponsor of this bill, the Surface Transportation Savings Act of 2010. The bill will lead to real savings and real deficit reduction, and we need to fight for that at this very difficult time in our country.As has been said, the Surface Transportation Savings Act of 2010 reduces the contract authority that is currently available for certain highway safety and transit programs by $107 million. Let me say that again, $107 million. That's real money. While this may not, in and of itself, directly reduce outlays this current fiscal year, it takes $107 million off the table so that it cannot be used to increase spending in the future.Now, as my colleague, Mr. Perriello, said, there are a couple of ways that this $107 million could be used to increase spending and increase the Federal budget deficit. We know that a future appropriations act could use these dollars and appropriate them and spend them on these current programs within the Department of Transportation. But let's be clear, there is a very real threat. The Congressional Budget Office may not see it, and I can understand why they may not trust the Congress to act responsibly, but twice already this Congress has tried to use these available dollars within other programs.H.R. 4899, the FY 2010 Emergency Supplemental Appropriations bill that was passed by the House of Representatives earlier this month included $2.2 billion of rescinded highway contract authorities. So these are dollars that were budgeted but were not spent. And again, if we don't act, those kinds of available dollars will be spent.Now, to make it even more directly relevant to this bill and to the Congressional Budget Office's analysis, H.R. 4899, this Emergency Supplemental Appropriations bill, tried to spend $25 million that would be taken off the table by this Surface Transportation Savings Act. So I don't think we could be any more clear than the threat that is before us.I couldn't agree more that we must address real deficit reduction one step at a time. This is a critical, critical step to do that. And I'll tell you, the people in Michigan's Seventh Congressional District believe $107 million is real money.By not acting, the threat is real that these available dollars will be spent. By passing this bill today, the United States House of Representatives will remove $107 million that would likely be spent for some other program.We must act to make sure that we restrain and constrain spending in a way that results in deficit reduction. That's why I'm proud to stand in support of this bill and hope that both my Democratic and Republican colleagues take decisive action to make sure that neither this Congress nor future Congresses spend money that we can't afford.BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT.",Surface Transportation Savings Act of 2010

Schauer wrote to Biden on June 22 on behalf of Full Spectrum Solutions, a Jackson-based business that manufactures energy efficient lighting products and had lost contracts due to other companies violating these provisions. Biden's response described immediate steps that the Department of Energy (DOE) will take to make the process fairer for American businesses, based on solutions Schauer proposed.""This is good news for businesses like Full Spectrum Solutions, American taxpayers, and American workers,"" said Schauer. ""I am encouraged by the nearly point-by-point response I received from Vice President Biden and the Department of Energy on this issue, especially at a time when job creation is so critical. We need to make sure our taxpayer dollars are creating jobs for workers here at home, and these changes will help us hold bad actors accountable, level the playing field for American businesses and open doors for companies like Full Spectrum Solutions to create more jobs right here in Michigan.""The solutions that the Administration and the DOE are implementing reflect nearly all of the suggestions made by Schauer in his letter. The DOE has now sent additional guidance to all grantees regarding their responsibilities under the Buy American provisions of the Recovery Act. A new mechanism has been created to give businesses a fast, effective way to report violations, as well as a streamlined process for the DOE to investigate and respond to complaints. The DOE is also investigating the specific claims of fraudulent activity raised by Full Spectrum Solutions.""This is exactly the kind of solution we were looking for when we approached Congressman Schauer with this problem, and thanks to his hard work, companies that play fair and comply with Buy American requirements will no longer lose contracts because of it,"" said Mike Nevins, President and CEO of Full Spectrum Solutions. ""This will make a big difference for businesses like ours that want to make sure our products, and the products we purchase from other companies, are helping American workers instead of workers in China.""""This is a big step in the right direction, but we must remain vigilant about enforcing our Buy American laws,"" said Schauer. ""We simply can't afford to waste our taxpayer dollars on products that create jobs for workers in China instead of here in America.""Copies of Schauer's letter to Biden, Biden's response, and the DOE's new Buy American Program Notice are included as attachments to this document.

My views are very clear, that we need to support trade policies that put American jobs and American workers first.The people at home that I represent have heard me say it, and I'm proud to say it on the floor of the House of Representatives here today. The time is now to fight for American jobs. The time is now to fight for American jobs.There's an issue that I'm working on that I think I've gotten some attention of certainly Democratic leadership that wants to fight for American jobs and manufacturing and American workers, and I think this is an issue where my friends on the other side of the aisle will embrace as well. I've already got one Republican cosponsor on H.R. 5312. And it's a very simple issue. It's about fairness. It's about fair trade rather than trade policies that, again, have cost us millions of jobs in this country.What I learned as I've been fighting for fair trade and giving our businesses, small businesses and large, an opportunity to make things again in my State and in this country, is that we have been using our tax dollars to support and create jobs in China rather than jobs here in the United States of America. As I dug into this issue, quite innocently, I was looking through some census promotional materials, and I was shocked to find that some of those materials to promote something that I support 110 percent, the United States Census, each of our communities needs to get its fair share of dollars to support education and housing and public safety, and so forth, but some of these promotional materials, you guessed it, were made in China.This is a key ring that--I carry this everywhere I go. And I show small businesses, tool and die shops, small manufacturers, they tell me that they could tool this little key chain, and it says, United States Census 2010. They could have the tooling done, they could have their manufacturing process ready in 1 week to make this little metal key chain.Now, what you may not be able to see at home, you may not be able to read where it says United States Census. And again, I want to remind you that your tax dollars are paying for this. There's a little sticker, and you guessed it, it says ``made in China.''Now, we can and we should make this with our tax dollars here. Now, China, when they joined the World Trade Organization in 2001, did not sign the government----BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT.Mr. SCHAUER. I have. Thank you for asking me that. I've heard a couple of interesting answers.And I also have a hat. The people that I represent at home see me with this hat. It's white, a very poor quality hat that says ``United States Census 2010,'' you guessed it, made in China. And the United States Census says, well, if products are substantially altered, substantially altered--this sounds like bureaucratic speak--can qualify as made in America.So I guess what they consider substantially altered is this little metal key chain that was made in China, apparently had the ``United States Census 2010'' printing done in the U.S., and that's substantially altered. The hat that I usually have with me--I don't have it tonight--same thing: the hat is made in China.BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT.Mr. SCHAUER. It satisfies the Buy American provision. I actually met with Commerce Secretary Gary Locke about this--and by the way, I have been appointed to the President's Export Council, and I plan to work on these American jobs issues--is if there are certain orders that have to be done quickly, that there is a loophole.BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT.Mr. SCHAUER. The point is there is no good answer. And so we as Democrats have to look at--we have to scour the law, all of our laws, and look at Buy American provisions and make sure there are no loopholes like these that allow our tax dollars to create jobs in other countries. It's not just China. There are T-shirts, I think it was, made in Honduras and so forth.BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT.Mr. SCHAUER. I was in Reading, Michigan, at a small business appreciation dinner. And I took the hat, took the key chain, and I said, Can anyone here make these? Hands went up. I mean, we can make these things. We do. And, in fact, when I testified before the House Ways and Means Committee on this issue, Congressman Sandy Levin held a hearing on our trading relationship with China. And the other thing that the Census Bureau says is, well, we don't make these things here, or we don't put them out--you know, we can't find folks here in the United States that make these.I took seven or eight hats from my office representing different groups in my district. One was from Grand Ledge High School, their baseball team cap. They were all made in America. And of course those items were of a much better quality than the hat that was made in China.My ultimate point is that China has been playing us for fools. China has been playing us for fools. They are eating our lunch. We are letting them do it. And so it's time for us collectively as Democrats, and I hope our Republican colleagues join us in this fight, it's time to fight for our jobs. This is a simple matter of fairness.I will sum up this issue that what my bill does, it's a straight issue of reciprocity, a true fair trade issue. And the way it works is that we will allow Chinese companies the same access to our government contracts as China's government is allowing our companies to have access to their government contracts. So if that number in China is zero, then you guessed it, no Chinese company will have access to our government contracts. If the number is a million, then there will be straight reciprocity. So it's time for us to decide which jobs we are going to use our tax dollars to support. And I think the answer for us as Democrats is those jobs are American jobs.BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT.",The Country's Economic Future
0,Mark Schauer,"Today Congressman Mark Schauer (D-MI) voted to rein in Wall Street, end taxpayer bailouts of big banks, and create a consumer financial protection bureau that finally puts consumers first. The Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act will end the era of abuses by ""too big to fail"" banks that have cost the American people 8 million jobs and $17 trillion in retirement savings and net worth.""The party's over for the high-flying Wall Street CEOs that drove our economy off a cliff,"" said Schauer. ""We simply can't afford to waste another penny on taxpayer-funded bailouts for big banks, while Michigan families and businesses are struggling to make ends meet. This is about doing what's fair. This bill will protect consumers, crack down on the risky practices that put our entire economy at risk, and help lay the groundwork to get our economy back on track.""The Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act will help prevent the risky financial practices that led to the financial meltdown and stop large financial firms from gambling with Americans' retirement and college savings and home values. In addition, taxpayers will no longer pay the price for Wall Street's irresponsibility. The bill creates a process to shut down large, failing firms whose collapse would put the entire economy at risk. After exhausting all of the company's assets, additional costs would be covered by a ""dissolution fund,"" to which all large financial firms would contribute.The bill will create the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), a new consumer watchdog devoted to protecting Americans from unfair and abusive financial practices. This independent bureau will provide clear and accurate information to families and small businesses to ensure that bank loans, mortgages, and credit cards are fair and affordable. Just like the FDA does for medical safety, the CFPB will set safety standards to prevent practices such as hidden credit card fees, deceptive ""fine print,"" and other financial abuses that have escaped oversight so far.The bill has been called the ""strongest set of Wall Street reforms in three generations"" by Elizabeth Warren, Chair of the nonpartisan Congressional Oversight Panel, and has been endorsed by the AARP, Consumer Federation of America, Consumers Union, Council of Institutional Investors, National Fair Housing Alliance, National Restaurant Association, Public Citizen, SEIU, and US PIRG, among other organizations. The bill was publicly debated for more than 50 hours, and includes over 70 Republican and bipartisan amendments.","Schauer Votes to Hold Big Banks Accountable, Protect Michigan Consumers"

0,Mark Schauer,"Today Congressman Mark Schauer (D-MI) sent a letter to Vice President Joe Biden calling on the Administration to crack down on unscrupulous firms that have received energy efficient lighting contracts under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act by changing the labels on products that were 100% made in China to say ""Made in the U.S.A."" The case was brought to Schauer's attention by Full Spectrum Solutions, a Jackson-based business which produces energy efficient lighting products and has lost contracts due to fraudulent labeling.""This is about basic fairness, and making sure American taxpayer dollars create jobs for American workers,"" said Schauer. ""It's time to crack down on the bad actors that are blatantly violating the ""Buy American' provision in the Recovery Act and using our tax dollars to create jobs in China. The Administration has a responsibility to enforce our laws so local businesses like Full Spectrum can compete fairly and create jobs right here in Michigan - and the time to act is now.""Section 1605 of the Recovery Act clearly states that none of the appropriated funds may be used for a public work, ""unless all of the iron, steel, and manufactured goods used in the project are produced in the United States."" While waivers are available in certain circumstances, none have been granted by the Department of Energy regarding the types of energy efficient lighting products made by Full Spectrum Solutions.Along with Full Spectrum Solutions, at least seven other American lighting companies in Michigan, Missouri, Georgia, and California have been affected by mislabeled Chinese products.In his letter to Vice President Biden, Schauer proposed several solutions to address this issue:A mechanism for businesses to report violations they believe to exist, and receive responses ""at the speed of business."" o Businesses in a particular industry are the parties most likely to be aware of the supply chains in their industry; in particular they are likely to have more information than local units of government about where and how products in their industry are made. o For reasons of accountability, such a mechanism should not be an anonymous system. o Complaints should be required to be accompanied by evidence that substantiates them at the time of submission.Increased awareness among buyers at all levels of government about this type of fraudulent activity so those who want to Buy American, or who are required to, can truly do so.An up-to-date, on-line resource for potential buyers that lists companies who have been found in violation of Buy American provisions, and companies against whom complaints are outstanding, so buyers can have access to that information as they are reviewing bids they receive.Increased public awareness about this type of fraudulent activity so consumers who want to Buy American will know to watch for it.More effective civil and criminal penalties to provide a practical, functional deterrent to businesses engaging in this sort of fraud.",Schauer Calls on Administration to Crack Down on Firms that Violate ARRA 'Buy American' Provisions

""I would request that you include substantial funding for low interest loans for the domestic automotive industry to retool and refit its operations to produce the next generation of low-emissions, alternative fuel vehicles.""While Gary Peters has made investment in next generation, alternative energy technologies a centerpiece of his plan to rebuild Michigan's economy, incumbent Congressman Joe Knollenberg has continued to back tax breaks for oil companies instead of promoting alternative energy.""Michigan's economy is facing unprecedented challenges, and we must take action now to help our auto industry and to create new jobs,"" Peters said.

0,Gary Peters,"Issue Position: Jump-Starting Michigan's EconomyFor the first time in the five generations that my family has lived in Oakland County, parents are starting to fear that they may not be able to provide as good a life for their children as the one their own parents gave them. I understand that feeling, and I know that's why we need to take action now to create jobs, invest in our businesses, give our workers a level playing field, and get Michigan's economy moving forward again.In Congress, I will take immediate action to:* Cut taxes for the middle class and small businesses;* Take away taxpayer-funded subsidies for Big Oil companies that are making record profits and charging us record prices at the pump and use that money to support new alternative energy industries;* Vote to get rid of tax breaks to companies that ship jobs overseas and instead give tax breaks to companies that create jobs here at home.Create JobsMichigan has lost over 94,000 jobs in just the first six months of 2008. And while President Bush and his followers in Washington have continued to pursue disastrous economic and fiscal policies, Michigan's economy has suffered the longest, sustained period of job losses since the Great Depression.Michigan is poised to take the lead in the emerging alternative energy industry, advanced biofuels and fuel cell technologies, and the next generation of fuel-efficient vehicles. We have an incredibly strong entrepreneurial tradition, along with an established industrial base, experienced workers, and some of the finest colleges and universities in the world.As America looks for new answers to our energy crisis, Michigan's universities and engineers can be developing new technologies, and our factories can be turning out wind turbines, solar cells, advanced batteries, and plug-in hybrid cars.We can't afford to wait any longer; we need to act now to invest in Michigan's economy. In Congress, I will work to end the failed policies of the Bush Administration that have cost us hundreds of thousands of jobs, and I will vote to invest in research and development to spur the growth of new technologies - like alternative energy and next generation vehicles - right here in Michigan.Restore the Strength of our Manufacturing and Automotive IndustryThe auto industry and manufacturing have formed the backbone of Michigan's economy over the past century, and I believe they will once again lead the way to as we work together to get our economy moving forward again.Our automotive industry has been hit harder by rising gas prices and this Administration's failed economic leadership than nearly any other industry in America. We need leaders who are willing to make a serious investment in American businesses and American workers, rather than keeping us locked in the policies of the past.In Congress, I will work to promote public-private partnerships with government, educational institutions, and the private sector working together to spur the development of fuel efficient vehicles, including hydrogen fuel cell automobiles and plug-in hybrids, and work to get those vehicles on the market and on the road as soon as possible.In the last six years alone, the U.S. has lost over 3 million manufacturing jobs. We must act now to restore the strength of our automotive and manufacturing industries here in Michigan, and our actions must be bold.A Level Playing Field for Michigan WorkersWhen the playing field is level, and the rules are fair, American workers and businesses can out-compete and out-perform any workers in the world. Unfortunately, the Bush Administration and its followers have pursued an unfair trade policy that has forced American workers to compete with sweatshops, child labor, and countries that violently suppress the rights of working men and women.In order to ensure a fair playing field, trade agreements must include fair labor protections and environmental standards, and they must be enforceable. In Congress, I will work to require that countries like China and Korea play by international rules, and I will insist that the World Trade Organization (WTO) address currency manipulation and non-tariff barriers that prevent the importation of American goods into certain foreign markets.I will also support the American Manufacturing Initiative (AMI), spearheaded by Senator Levin and Congressman Dingell. The AMI recognizes that our manufacturers are not just competing against foreign companies but rather they are competing against entire foreign countries that aggressively support their manufacturers. We must do the same.Health CareAnother factor that puts American workers and businesses at a disadvantage is the skyrocketing cost of health care. Unlike every other developed nation, the United States does not guarantee health care to our citizens. This places the burden of health care costs squarely on the shoulders of our businesses, drives up operating costs and puts us at a competitive disadvantage.One of my first priorities in Washington will be making sure that every American has access to affordable, high-quality health care and the choice of a family doctor they trust: a plan they choose, and coverage that can't be taken away if someone changes jobs or gets laid off. Read more about health care here.Invest in Small BusinessesJust like the auto industry and our manufacturing sector, small businesses are being hurt by the rising costs of fuel and health care, and many are struggling to break even.As a businessman and investment advisor, I know first-hand what is necessary for a small business to grow and thrive.In the Michigan Senate, I worked to cut taxes for small businesses to help them create good paying jobs here in Michigan. I voted to exempt small businesses from having to pay taxes on wages for new employees, and to allow businesses to deduct unemployment expenses, FCTA taxes, and workers compensation costs.In Congress, I will work to cut taxes for small businesses and provide incentives for them to invest in new equipment and new facilities - and to hire new employees. The economic stimulus package passed by Congress this year was a good start, but we need to do even more to ease the burden on small businesses and enable them to grow and thrive.",Issue Position: Jump-Starting Michigan's Economy
0,Gary Peters,"I know a thing or two about fiscal discipline.

0,Gary Peters,"As we work to get our economy back on track, we must realize that education is a central component of economic development. If America does not lead the world in education, our future workforce will be less productive and less globally competitive. I am committed to a strong public education system that provides children with the skills they need to succeed in the 21st century economy. That means access to quality public schools for all children and an affordable college education for all who pursue one. As a member of the Science and Technology Committee, I recognize the need to bolster science, technology, engineering, and math programs in our public school system. These investments benefit our children now and strengthen America's long-term economic success.-Investing in our Public Schools-Making College More AffordableInvesting in our Public SchoolsA healthy public education system is critical to ensuring America's children grow up with the skills they need to be competitive in the 21st century global economy. Many states are facing severe budget shortfalls and have already been forced to make cuts to K-12 education. Federal action was necessary to help ensure the recession did not cause our children's education to suffer. That's why I voted to bring over $3 billion in investments to Michigan's schools, $52 million for Oakland County schools alone, through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (also known as the stimulus bill). In order to provide relief to local schools and ease the burden on state budgets, the ARRA provided federal IDEA and Title 1 grants as well as investments in school modernization construction and direct help to local school districts with budget shortfalls through State Stabilization fund. While some see education and economic development as separate issues, I believe they are one in the same. The education investments in the economic recovery plan will create new jobs now make America's workforce more globally competitive.One of the most important pieces of legislation affecting K-12 education, the ""No Child Left Behind Act"" (NCLB,) will come up for reauthorization this year. While the original goals of improving student achievement and holding schools and teachers to tougher accountability standards should be maintained, the Act has put an underfunded federal mandate on our local districts for years and significant modifications to the legislation are needed to fully achieve its goals. I support changes that maintain original goals of NCLB while also easing the burden of unfunded mandates, revising Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) standards and sanctions and providing reasonable flexibility to states and local schools.Fighting for Local SchoolsA difficult State budget environment has affected all residents, and schools have been especially hard hit. Michigan's FY10 School aid budget included a $165 per pupil cut, and a $51 million cut for 41 districts knows as ""20j"" districts. The 20j cuts were particularly painful for Michigan's 9th District, hitting 7 local districts and amounting to over $10 million in cuts. In response to 20j and additional education cuts, I contacted State leaders raising concerns about the loss of federal monies that could occur if the State education cuts remain. I fought for years to maintain funding at our 20j districts as a state senator, and I will continue to speak out against cuts for our kids now.Return to TopMaking College More AffordableAs tuitions across the country continue to rise, more and more Michigan families are finding it impossible to finance their child's education. Congress must act to ensure that students who work hard can afford a college degree. As a former college professor and a parent, I understand the value of higher education and the challenges Michigan students face when confronted with rising tuition costs and a tough economy. Today's global economy increasingly demands that students complete some post-high school education to be successful and compete with workers around the world. While some view education and the economy as separate issues, I have always insisted they are one in the same. A federal investment in education is an investment in our economic stability; nothing could be more important. That's why one of the first bills I introduced after coming to Congress in January, the Helping Families Afford to Work Act, would create a tax credit of up to $5,000 per student for tuition and related expenses for up to five years of post secondary education. I also voted to increase the maximum Pell Grant Award by $500 to $5,350 for 2009-2010 and to $5,550 for 2010-2011. This increase will help more students pay for their college education. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (also known as the stimulus bill) provided investments in postsecondary education through the State Stabilization Fund. This additional funding helped colleges and universities prevent faculty and staff layoffs, maintain or expand their student enrollment and create jobs though repairs, renovations and modernizations on campus.In September of 2009, the House of Representatives passed landmark legislation that represents the greatest investment in higher education in congressional history. The Student Aid and Fiscal Responsibility Act bill stops government subsidies for private lenders, saving taxpayer dollars. By converting all federal lending to direct loans, rather than routing loans through agencies that skim off the top, the bill saves $87 billion over ten years, some of which will used for the Pell Grant and Perkins Loan Program to provide more students with help paying for college, while the remainder will be used to help pay down the deficit. I was a proud supporter of this outstanding bill and hope to see it signed into law this year.",Issue Position: Education

0,Gary Peters,"I believe that transparency is at the foundation of good government, and that taxpayers have a right to know how their tax dollars are being spent. This is why I have introduced H.Res.135, the Holding Congress Accountable Act. This legislation will require every Member of Congress to post a link to their office's annual disbursements on their public websites. I have compiled my expenditure data from my office, and it is available here.This information comes from the Statement of Disbursements, which is a quarterly report of all receipts and expenditures for Members of Congress, Committees, Leadership, House Officers and Offices of the House of Representatives. I ran my office so efficiently last year that I came in $180,000 under budget. This saved taxpayer money, and these funds were used to reduce the federal budget deficit. I believe all representatives should be held to this standard, and I will work to advance the Holding Congress Accountable Act and continue to fight for transparent government that is accountable to taxpayers.One of Congress' most important responsibilities is to protect taxpayers by reducing waste and keeping government spending under control. We must restore honest, transparent accounting and get serious about addressing our budget deficit head on. We need to cut government waste, stop corporations from hiding their money in overseas tax shelters and responsibly end the Iraq War. We also need to enact strong Pay-as-you-go legislation to force Congress to reign in spending by requiring that any new spending proposed be paid for elsewhere in the budget rather than through borrowing. Congress should also create a bipartisan debt commission to identify budget reforms necessary to balance the budget over the long-term. If Congress does these things, we can balance the budget and reduce America's debt while cutting middle class and small business taxes and continuing to make critical investments for long-term job creation.You can read my ten principles for deficit reduction here.I believe we must also protect taxpayers by ensuring that Americans never again finance a Wall Street bailout, and are repaid every penny of the bailout Congress and the Bush Adminstration created in 2008. I am very proud to have authored legislation that passed the House to ensure that the TARP program, also known as the Wall Street bailout, does not cost taxpayers one cent.In December 2009, the House of Representatives passed the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (H.R. 4173). This comprehensive legislation reins in out of control Wall Street bonuses and executive compensation schemes that lead to excessive risk taking. It ensures that there will be no more bailouts of ""Too Big to Fail"" financial institutions by giving regulators the power to identify which large, interconnected institutions pose systemic risk to the larger economy and subjecting them to heightened oversight and by giving the government the authority to unwind failing institutions in an orderly fashion so they do not threaten the entire economy.H.R. 4173 also contained an amendment I authored which ensures that taxpayers will not be on the hook for a single penny of the TARP program, also known as the Wall Street bailout. My amendment requires the same large financial institutions that caused the financial crisis to pay for any shortfalls in the $700 billion TARP program.As a state senator, I ran my office so efficiently that I returned a full year's operating budget to the people of Michigan over the course of my tenure. I am now bringing this same philosophy to Washington. I ran my Congressional office significantly under budget in 2009, saving taxpayers tens of thousands of dollars. Renewing Congress' commitment to fiscal responsibility will allow us to move toward a balanced budget and focus on investing in what is important to families in Michigan and across the United States, such as job creation, stronger schools, better roads and advanced technology vehicle production while providing tax relief to working families and small businesses.New Tax Cuts I SupportedA strong middle class is necessary for a strong America. Working families need and deserve tax relief, and I am proud to have voted for the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (a.k.a. the stimulus bill), which provided the quickest, broadest tax cut in U.S. history. The Recovery Act provides 95% of Americans with a tax break, while also expanding the refundable child tax credit and providing small business tax incentives to business to create jobs and spur investment.During tough economic times, tax relief is critical to both easing the burden facing middle class families and jumpstarting the economy. Hard working, middle class families are taking home more money in every paycheck. Nearly four million Michigan residents are benefitting from this tax cut.To create new jobs in Michigan, we must make it easier for small businesses to grow. I supported tens of billions of dollars in tax cuts for businesses making capital investments, targeted tax cuts to keep struggling businesses afloat and proposed a plan to redirect Wall Street bailout funds to help provide small business loans instead.To help boost sagging home values, I supported an $8,000 tax credit for first time homebuyers to help reduce the glut of homes on the market. Tens of thousands of Michigan residents took advantage of this credit to purchase new homes. When the credit was set to expire on December 1 of last year, I fought to have it extended until May 2010, and expanded to provide a credit for existing homebuyers to purchase new homes as well.I supported a similar provision to boost auto sales by creating a deduction of sales tax on new cars purchases, expected to generate nearly 100,000 new car sales this year. I am also proud to have cosponsored and voted for legislation enacting the popular ""Cash for Clunkers"" program. The Car Allowance Rebate System gave car buyers rebates of up to $4,500 if they traded in less fuel-efficient vehicles for new vehicles that met certain fuel efficiency requirements. This effective program helped sell hundreds of thousands of efficient vehicles, boosting the economy, creating jobs, reducing emissions, and helping thousands of families afford a new vehicle.Finally, I fought to shield middle class taxpayers from the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT). The AMT was originally intended to only apply to the very wealthiest Americans and prevent them from using loopholes to circumvent paying all federal taxes. Because it was never indexed for inflation, the AMT would have burdened over 25 million middle class taxpayers if Congress had failed to act this year. I urged House and Senate leadership to include AMT relief for the middle class in the economic recovery plan. Leadership responded and included the fix in the recovery plan, stopping the AMT from hitting thousands of Oakland County residents a tax increase this year.Legislation I Authored to Cut TaxesI have made cutting taxes for middle class families a top priority because rising expenses and stagnant wages are squeezing the middle class like never before. That is why two of the first bills that I introduced as a United States Congressman, the Helping Families Afford to Work Act and the Helping Families Afford Tuition Act, are critical tax cuts for the middle class.The Helping Families Afford to Work Act increases and expands the Dependent Care Tax Credit (DCTC) to help working families afford quality child care. The Act would provide an annual tax credit of up to $6,000 to help offset the rapidly rising cost of child care. While the cost of child care has risen rapidly since President Reagan signed the credit into law in 1981, the value of the DCTC has largely remained stagnant and actually decreased dramatically when adjusted for inflation. In fact, the average price of full-time center day care in the U.S. increased at almost twice the rate of inflation in recent years. The average Michigan family now spends between $6,032 and $8,996 a year for child care. Meanwhile, because the DCTC has not kept pace with inflation, it is now worth less than half its original value.Some parents are finding that child care costs are so high they can barely afford to work. That's why I introduced the Helping Families Afford to Work Act to provide a tax cut for families to offset the rapidly rising cost of child care. This is a necessary, common sense bill that provides relief to middle class families and stimulates the economy by allowing families to keep and spend more of their own money. I was pleased to see President Obama call to expand the DCTC during his State of the Union Address, and I will continue fighting to provide this important tax relief for middle class families.The Helping Families Afford Tuition Act provides up to a $5,000 per student tax credit for tuition and related expenses for up to five years of post secondary education. Rapidly rising tuition costs have increasingly become a significant barrier for students seeking a college education. With this legislation, we have an opportunity to invest in our nation's students, relieve the financial burden middle class families face in sending their children to college, and help our next generation of workers compete in the global economy.Cracking Down on Fraud and Offshore Tax HavensOffshore tax havens and secrecy jurisdictions currently hold trillions of dollars in assets, and some of these havens are allowing corporations to hide billions of dollars and avoid paying their fair share in taxes. If we crackdown on these havens, we can reduce the deficit, provide major tax relief for honest taxpayers and make key job creating investments in our country.International professionals including tax attorneys, bankers, brokers, trust administrators, accountants, and corporate service providers have created an intricate offshore industry that aggressively promotes offshore jurisdictions as a means for large corporations to avoid paying taxes in their home jurisdictions. These professionals, many of whom are located or do business in the United States, advise and assist corporations and wealthy individuals on opening offshore accounts, establishing shell corporations and sham trusts, hiding assets in offshore jurisdictions, and making secret use of their offshore assets here at home. Experts estimate that the U.S. loses between $70 and $100 billion in taxes each year through the use of these illegal offshore tax schemes.That is why I have cosponsored the Stop Tax Haven Abuse Act. This bill, sponsored by Senator Carl Levin, will crack down on the use of offshore tax havens. These abuses rob honest taxpayers of an estimated $100 billion every year. The bill intends to stop tax haven abuse through a multi-pronged approach: increasing penalties for using tax havens, increasing the IRS's ability to prosecute tax shelter abuses, increasing penalties and enforcement of tax shelter promoters and tightening economic substance rules. Simply enforcing the current tax code and requiring corporations to pay their taxes just like honest families will allow us to cut the deficit, provide tax breaks for middle class families that need them and make job creating investments here at home.Reducing Wasteful SpendingCongress holds the purse strings of the federal government and therefore has the duty to be good stewards of the taxpayers' money. It is important to the national economy that our government spends wisely. On every issue our nation faces, it is our responsibility to ensure that the policies we pursue are consistent with the values held by the people we represent.I believe that we must invest responsibly on priorities such as job creation, education and social security. And reducing unnecessary spending will allow us to continue to cut taxes for small businesses and hardworking families, while shrinking the massive budget deficit built up over the past decade. I have worked with my colleagues in both parties to control budget deficits and fight the growth of our national debt, and I have voted against Democratic leadership to oppose hundreds of billions of dollars in spending since coming to Congress in January 2009. Currently, our debt's cost is one of the fastest growing expenses in the federal budget. We must reduce our national debt by returning to smart, responsible fiscal policies. By doing this we can not only cut the deficit, but one day return to the budget surpluses enjoyed in the late 1990s.We must ensure that new tax cuts and spending commitments are paid for without burdening our children and grandchildren with excessive debt. I believe that a crucial step in restoring fiscal discipline and reducing wasteful spending is the enforcement of pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) budgeting rules which require new spending commitments or tax changes to be paid for by cuts to other programs or new revenue--rather than simply borrowing the money and adding to our debt. That's why I cosponsored legislation to make PAYGO law.While enacting PAYGO is a step in the right direction, we must work aggressively to shrink our budget deficit. We need a comprehensive plan in place for controlling spending and charting a path to shrink our national debt in the long-term. I support the creation of a bipartisan debt commission that would recommend a comprehensive package of spending cuts to be voted on by Congress. I was one of only 19 members of my party to vote to cap discretionary spending in July of last year, and I am pleased that President Obama announced his support for this idea in January. I will continue voting against unnecessary spending and working with my colleagues to find ways to cut waste and shrink our nation's deficits.",Issue Position: Budget and Tax Cuts
0,Gary Peters,"This is one of the most challenging times Michigan has faced in its 162-year history. Americans are struggling across the country, and we in Michigan have been facing a recession longer than any other state. Getting our economy back on track must be job one and is my central focus every day. To do that, we must create the conditions to allow Michigan's entrepreneurs to grow and create jobs and provide relief for Michigan families. That means we must: cut taxes for small businesses and middle class families, get loans to small businesses flowing again, invest in new hi-tech industries, preserve and modernize our auto industry and create fair trade policies that allow Michigan workers and businesses to compete and succeed in the global economy. Our people have faced down great challenges in the past, and if we enact sound policies that support our workers and business owners, Michigan will again become the global economic engine as it has been in the past.Supporting Small BusinessesCreating the environment that allows small businesses to grow is critical to creating jobs and reducing Michigan's unemployment rate. Small businesses employ half of all private sector employees and are responsible for creating created 60-80% of all new jobs over the last decade. By serving as a platform for new ideas and new investment, small businesses create thousands of new, local jobs that will be central to Michigan's economic recovery. That is why fighting to give entrepreneurs the tools they need to succeed will always be one of my top priorities.Our current financial crisis has adversely affected every sector of our economy, and small business is no exception. Frozen credit markets can make it impossible to get a loan to start a new business or expand an existing one. In November, I convened a field hearing in which Members of Congress traveled to Southeast Michigan to hear directly from small business owners and experts on Michigan entrepreneurs lack of access to affordable credit. The following month, I voted against the jobs bill introduced by House leadership because it lacked sufficient support for small businesses. I then advanced my own plan calling for $40 billion in unspent Wall Street bailout funds to be redirected to provide small business loans. In January, the President announced he endorsed the use of Wall Street bailout funding for small businesses instead.To specifically help areas as hard hit as Michigan, I wrote an amendment to the Small Business Financing and Investment Act (H.R. 3854) that would provide up to $70,000 in zero interest loans with more favorable repayment terms to areas with high unemployment. My amendment will also make high-unemployment areas eligible for the New Market Venture Capital Program, providing extra incentive to invest in places such as Oakland County that have extra need.I also supported provisions in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (also known as the stimulus bill) that provided $13 billion in loans, lines of credit and capital for small firms to provide a financial market that is friendly to small businesses. To further free up the lending market, the Obama Administration recently proposed the release of $15 billion of TARP funds to create a secondary market for SBA loans. This will allow banks to get credit flowing to small businesses and I fully support this plan.In Oakland County, we are painfully aware of the effects that the Wall Street crisis has had on our economy. I believe that part of making sure Wall Street doesn't disrupt our economy again means making sure that local banks are able to lend in Oakland County. I am also a strong believer that we need to encourage private-sector small business lending in an effort to create an environment in which those with good ideas who will work hard can access the capital they need to succeed. I am an original cosponsor of legislation that would expand the Small Business Administration's Express Loan Program, which allows local banks a greater deal of discretion in lending to small businesses in the community and cuts down on the time and red tape in between local entrepreneurs and the capital they need to revitalize our economy.The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act contains additional measures supporting small businesses. The Recovery Act will invest $7.2 billion in IT infrastructure, which over 100 high-tech CEO's have said will create hundreds of thousands of new jobs--more than half of which will be in small businesses. The Recovery Act also provides small businesses with $30 billion in tax relief, targeted to spur investment and job creation.By giving entrepreneurs the tools they need to survive the difficult economy and thrive in the years ahead, small business will continue to be the engine of US job creation, strengthen our communities and develop the products and services that will ensure America continues to lead in the 21st century.Creating New Manufacturing Jobs and Investing in 21st Century TechnologyA healthy manufacturing base is critical to the security of the American middle class and must be a key component of our economic recovery. In order to maintain competitiveness in the global marketplace, U.S. manufacturers must adapt to new technological developments and economic changes. Other nations have committed billions of dollars to support new automotive, clean energy and other manufacturing technologies because they know they represent the jobs of the future. Our country needs to do the same or we'll get left behind.I authored the Advanced Vehicle Technology Act of 2009 (HR 3246), which provides the Department of Energy with $2.85 billion over five years to partner with automakers, parts suppliers, universities, and industry consortiums to conduct innovative research and development projects. This funding will help ensure that the next generation of vehicles and vehicle technologies will be built right here in the United States. This legislation will create jobs in Oakland County and reduce America's dependence on foreign oil. H.R. 3246 passed the House on September 16, 2009 by a large bipartisan vote of 312-114, and was endorsed by the Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers, General Motors, Ford Motor Company, Chrysler, the UAW, the Motor and Equipment Manufacturers Association, Magna International, Delphi, ArvinMeritor, Robert Bosch LLC, Caterpillar, Dueco Odyne, Achates Power, the Engine Manufacturers Association, the League of Conservation Voters, the Sierra Club, and the Natural Resources Defense Council.The Manufacturing Extension Partnership is a critical national program that provides technical services and assistance to increase productivity and efficiency of small and medium-sized manufacturers. MEP support is vital to the long term success and competitiveness of small and medium sized American manufacturers, and preserving and strengthening the program should be a priority as Congress continues its efforts to revive the economy. Currently the costs of the MEP's services are shared between the federal government, state government, and industry with the federal government contributing one third, and states and industry contributing the remaining two thirds. However, state budget problems have destabilized the MEP funding structure. At least 23 state MEP centers reported a decrease or elimination of state MEP funding in 2009 alone, and some centers have been operating without state funding for years. When a state eliminates MEP funding, it is left to the manufacturers to cover the gap or risk losing critical federal dollars. I introduced legislation with Republican Rep. Vern Ehlers this year that would reduce the matching requirements for small manufacturers and strengthen the MEP program. H.R. 4393 would reduce the financial burden on small business during a recession and align the MEP's structure with other public-private programs operated by the government by reducing the match requirement. I look forward to continuing working with my colleagues in a bipartisan fashion to champion policies and programs that support American manufacturing.There is a great potential to revitalize our domestic manufacturing base by strengthening the domestic solar industry. While states like Michigan and many others certainly have the existing infrastructure and workforce to manufacture more solar technologies, the United States continues to lag behind China, Japan, and Europe in the manufacturing of photovoltaic modules. On October 22, 2009 the House passed H.R. 3585, the Solar Technology Roadmap Act. This important bill will strengthen our nation's solar energy industry and help us meet our domestic goals for renewable energy production. The bill will establish a roadmap and demonstration program to further advance solar technologies. The final version passed by the House included an amendment I authored to require the Department of Energy to give preference to projects in high unemployment states like Michigan. My amendment also required that all research, development and manufacturing resources be allocated in the United States. I believe that federal dollars should work to create American jobs, and this amendment seeks to ensure that these new investments are working to restore jobs lost in recent years.Supporting our Domestic Automobile IndustryThe global race to create the ultra-efficient cars and other new manufacturing technologies of the 21st Century has begun, and the United States is already giving other nations a tremendous head start. If we want to maintain our economic competitiveness, create jobs and truly become energy independent, we must support our manufacturing sector and auto industry at the same pace as other countries.I have made fighting for our American automakers one of my top priorities. When Chrysler and GM were facing extinction, I strongly supported providing bridge loans to allow the companies to rebound from the global credit crisis. I stood up to Chrysler's debt holders, four major banks and a few dozen hedge funds who were trying to squeeze Chrysler for more than the fair market value of their debt. I argued they should make a good business decision and accept market price rather than the force the company into liquidation, and ultimately they did. When two of our Oakland County General Motors plants were facing permanent shutdown, I founded the Make it in Michigan campaign which earned the support of 30,000 citizens in asking GM to make their new subcompact car in Michigan. GM ultimately did decide to make their new car in Michigan, keeping two plants open and saving 1,400 jobs.Now we must support our domestic auto industry in the global competition to build the fuel efficient cars of the future. I authored the Advanced Vehicle Technology Act of 2009 (HR 3246), which provides the Department of Energy with $2.85 billion over five years to partner with automakers, parts suppliers, universities, and industry consortiums to conduct innovative research and development projects. This funding will help ensure that the next generation of vehicles and vehicle technologies will be built right here in the United States. This legislation will create jobs in Oakland County and reduce America's dependence on foreign oil. H.R. 3246 passed the House on September 16, 2009 by a large bipartisan vote of 312-114, and was endorsed by the Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers, General Motors, Ford Motor Company, Chrysler, the UAW, the Motor and Equipment Manufacturers Association, Magna International, Delphi, ArvinMeritor, Robert Bosch LLC, Caterpillar, Dueco Odyne, Achates Power, the Engine Manufacturers Association, the League of Conservation Voters, the Sierra Club, and the Natural Resources Defense Council.I am also a proud supporter of the Car Allowance Rebate System (CARS) Act, also known as the Cash for Clunkers program. CARS was initially approved by the Congress as part of the Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2009, and provided $1 billion in funding. When the program proved so popular that this funding was due to be completely exhausted within a matter of weeks, Congress passed emergency legislation providing an additional $2 billion in funding. There were over 690,000 transactions completed in the program, which provided an important boost for our automakers and helped result in positive GDP growth and economic expansion at a time when it was desperately needed. It also helped create a more fuel efficient vehicle fleet, resulting in a 9.2 MPG increase in average fuel economy.Economic Recovery ActThe American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (H.R. 1, also known as the stimulus bill) was enacted on February 17, 2009. The Act consisted of three parts: roughly one-third was tax cuts for families and businesses (one of the largest tax cuts in U.S. history), another one-third was emergency support including help for unemployed workers and funding to preserve education and public safety jobs, and the final one-third consisted of direct job-creating investments in things like infrastructure improvements and new technology development (efforts to prop up Wall Street banks were not part of the Recovery Act; the bill to approve that program--known as TARP--was enacted in the fall of 2008).The Recovery Act has already meant 69,000 additional jobs for Michigan in 2009 and a payroll tax cut for over four million Michigan residents. More jobs will be created as much of the job-creating investments will be dispersed in 2010. The Recovery Act has meant about 2 million more jobs across the U.S., according to both liberal and conservative economists. America lost nearly 750,000 jobs per month at the height of the crisis in early 2009, and the economy contracted 6% at the start of last year. Since the Recovery Act was passed in February of 2009, job losses steadily decreased until the U.S. saw net positive job creation in November and over 5% growth in the economy in the fourth quarter of '09. The Recovery Act has helped to get the economy moving in the right direction--but we must keep working.The problem is, while the Recovery Act has meant 2 million more jobs than we'd have otherwise and is on track to meet its goal of creating or saving 3.5 million jobs, the recession that began in late 2007 has lead to the U.S. losing 8 million jobs. Clearly, there is much more work to be done before our economy is fully recovered. I do not believe that government alone can get our economy back on track, but what it can do is help create the conditions necessary to get businesses to invest and create even more jobs. The Recovery Act's middle class tax cuts, homebuyer tax credit, car buyer tax credit and assistance for the unemployed helped jumpstart consumer spending. The business tax cuts, additional funding to repair Michigan roads and investments in new technologies (such as new advanced battery development in Michigan) are creating jobs and helping to create the environment necessary for businesses to hire again. Economists from the left and right agree that the Recovery Act kept us from falling into the 2nd Great Depression during the greatest economic crisis in generations, and is continuing to create the conditions for private business to grow.What has the Economic Recovery Act meant for Oakland County?Protecting Home ValuesSince the collapse of the housing market in 2006, home values have been falling, and it is estimated that homeowners have lost as much as $5.9 trillion in home value since that time. Because concentrated foreclosures can bring down home prices in an entire neighborhood, the first step in stabilizing home values has to be ending the tide of foreclosures and making it easier for families who have seen the value of their homes sharply decline refinance their mortgage. Getting our housing markets back on track not only will help millions of families save their homes, it will also help lead to greater economic expansion and quicker recovery due to the huge economic impact of new housing construction.The main tool to help families facing foreclosure is the Making Home Affordable (MHA) Program, which was announced by President Obama on February 18, 2009. The MHA Program has two parts -- one which allows homeowners with mortgages owned or guaranteed by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac to refinance into a new, more affordable mortgage as long as they don't owe more than 125% of the current value of their home. The second part of this program seeks to encourage mortgage servicers to provide modifications that will result in lower monthly payments for troubled borrowers. Borrowers who obtained their mortgage for a single family home that is their primary residence before January 1, 2009 are eligible for monthly mortgage payments lowered to no more than 31% of their monthly income.In 2008 Congress created the Hope for Homeowners Program, in 2009 Congress passed and the President signed into law the Helping Families Save Their Homes Act of 2009 which makes a number of improvements to that program. Under Hope for Homeowners, the mortgage lender agrees to write the mortgage down to a percentage of the home's currently appraised value, and the borrower receives a new 40 year fixed rate mortgage loan insured by the FHA. For more information about this program visit http://www.hud.gov/hopeforhomeowners/consumerfactsheet.cfm, or contact your lender, or a HUD approved non-profit housing counselor.

Currency manipulation on the part of China and other nations drives the cost of their imports down while pushing the cost of our exports up. Poorly written trade deals and a lack of enforcement on existing trade rules have pushed our trade deficit higher and higher. Japan and South Korea continue to employ unfair trade barriers to continue to block our automakers from selling cars there. Congress must unite across party lines and work with the administration to support fair trade for American businesses and workers.Those who favor the uninhibited free trade policies of the previous administration attempt to label anyone who does not agree with them as ""protectionist."" The notion that we must either support unadulterated free trade or put up walls and trade with no one is a false choice. The issue is not whether we should have more or less trade, it is about creating reasonable rules and enacting agreements that ensure that trade is fair for American workers and businesses so that trade creates jobs at home, rather than ship them overseas.For example, I supported a U.S. ""Cash for Clunkers"" program in which only American built cars could participate, but we were told that would violate international trade rules. However, the Japanese then crafted a Clunkers program in which American cars were effectively barred from participating. I spoke out against this injustice, and Japan promised they would allow American cars to participate. However, Japan later went back on this promise, allowing just a few U.S. models to participate. This is a clear example of unfair trade and I am continuing to fight it.I believe all international trade agreements must contain internationally recognized, enforceable labor and environmental standards. Agreements should also ensure that markets in strategic industries are opened for both nations, unlike, for example, the free trade agreement President Bush negotiated with South Korea. There is already a tremendous imbalance in the flow of automobiles between South Korea and the United States--in recent years, South Korea has sold over 700,000 vehicles here, while America has been permitted to sell only around 4,500. The Korea Free Trade Agreement would make this imbalance permanent. I will never support this deal as it is currently written.However, if a trade agreement contains key protections for workers and the environment, fairly opens markets for U.S. business and will create good paying jobs in critical industries, that agreement should be considered.When trade is fair, competition is fair, and when competing on a level playing field, American workers and business owners will win.",Issue Position: Economy and Job Creation
0,Gary Peters,"Our auto companies have been held to strict accountability standards as a condition for receiving government support. It is true that if our auto companies are receiving tax dollars they need to be accountable to taxpayers. However, Wall Street--and our government, for that matter--do not seem to think they need to be equally accountable to taxpayers. I believe that Wall Street financial firms and the government must be held to similarly tough criterion--no double standards. That's why I'm fighting to hold large banks and hedge funds accountable for their actions which pushed our economy to the brink and ensure they cannot endanger our economy again. I also authored legislation to guarantee that large financial firms pay back every penny of their bailout to taxpayers, and am fighting to end government bailouts in the future and make the federal government more open, transparent and accountable for our tax dollars.Common Sense Rules for Wall StreetAfter hearing story after story about Wall Street firms giving millions in bonuses to the very people who helped create the financial crisis, many expressed their outrage. It's not enough to simply talk about the egregiousness of these bonuses; it is also incumbent upon Congress to do something. I co-authored legislation to recover egregious bonuses to return them to taxpayers. This is a common-sense approach that constitutional scholars agree is legally sound. That's why the House passed the bill by a bipartisan three-to-one margin and why so many Americans are behind this action.But the larger issue is whether financial executives who caused this economic crisis will be allowed to continue business as usual. As a condition of receiving federal support, auto companies were forced to restructure to ensure long-term viability. The same should have been required of financial institutions last year. Since coming to Congress, one of my top priorities has been reforming the financial sector to protect taxpayers, get our economy moving and ensure the industry cannot wreak havoc on our economy in the future.In December 2009, the House of Representatives passed the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (H.R. 4173). This comprehensive legislation reins in out of control Wall Street bonuses and executive compensation schemes that lead to excessive risk taking. It ensures that there will be no more bailouts of ""Too Big to Fail"" financial institutions by giving regulators the power to identify which large, interconnected institutions pose systemic risk to the larger economy and subjecting them to heightened oversight and by giving the government the authority to unwind failing institutions in an orderly fashion so they do not threaten the entire economy. The legislation creates a new Consumer Financial Protection Agency that will shine light on currently unregulated entities like mortgage brokers and payday lenders and provide important protections for consumers in the mortgage market by banning deceptive practices and requiring lenders to offer loans only to customers with a demonstrated ability to repay. The Wall Street Reform Act also regulates the over the counter (OTC) derivatives market. Abuse of these products by AIG and Wall Street investment firms and hedge funds contributed significantly to the recent financial meltdown and ensuing economic crisis.The Wall Street Reform Act also contained an amendment I authored which ensures that taxpayers will not be on the hook for a single penny of TARP program, also known as the Wall Street bailout. My amendment requires the same large financial institutions that caused the financial crisis to pay for any shortfalls in the $700 billion TARP program.Congress has already acted to protect consumers against some of the worst practices by passing into law the Credit Cardholders Bill of Rights (H.R. 627). This legislation protects consumers from hidden fees, arbitrary rate changes and other egregious practices. This legislation also included language contained in a common sense amendment that I offered which would require that consumers' payments be applied to the portion of their balance with the highest interest rate first. Previously, a credit card company could require a consumer to pay off all other debt before they allowed the principle with the highest interest rate be paid, unfairly costing consumers money.I have also authored legislation called the Shareholder Empowerment Act (H.R. 2861) that would allow shareholders--a company's true owners--to vote on executive pay and require the use of independent compensation advisors to make objective recommendations on executive pay. My plan gives shareholders the right to deny golden parachutes to executives who do not perform, and gives them greater authority to recoup bonuses awarded on the basis of fraudulent earnings data.I was an advocate of these reforms long before outrage exploded over AIG's bonuses. We needed to act to return AIG bonuses to taxpayers, but we must go further to restructure the financial industry. This is central to getting our economy growing again, and protecting folks on Main Street from getting burned by Wall Street.Transparency and Accountability in GovernmentA democracy only functions properly when there is vigilant oversight to continuously make government more transparent, ethical and accountable, and to create vigorous oversight mechanisms to prevent abuse and protect tax dollars. That's why I voted for tough standards to prevent waste and fraud in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (a.k.a. the stimulus bill). The Recovery Act includes protection of whistleblowers who report waste and a website, www.recovery.gov, to disclose all information on government contracts and spending. No earmarks or pet projects were allowed in the plan and the Recovery Act Accountability and Transparency Board will review management of recovery dollars to ensure they are used efficiently.To further protect tax dollars, I called for a congressional pay freeze and co-sponsored H.R. 156, the Stop the Congressional Pay Raise Act of 2009, to prevent Members of Congress from receiving a pay increase until at least 2011. Members of Congress should not receive a pay increase while so many Americans are taking pay cuts or losing their incomes altogether. The pay freeze proposed last year has now become law, and I have now cosponsored additional legislation to prevent a pay increase until at least 2012.In addition to protecting taxpayer dollars, I believe that transparency is at the foundation of good government. Legislation should be available to the public to read and review before Congress votes. I urged House leadership to post the final health care reform bill for at least 72 hours before a final vote, and they have agreed to do so. I will continue to fight for transparent government that is accountable to taxpayers.",Issue Position: Oversight and Accountability

I will fight for a plan based on full accountability from both the Iraqi government and the Administration. Accountability starts with benchmarks to measure progress and a clear plan to bring our troops home. In addition to the tragic loss of military and civilian life, Bush's failed Iraq policy has distracted our leaders, diverted precious resources, and weighed down the economy. We need to bring the Iraq War to an honorable conclusion and bring our troops home, so we can refocus our priorities onto our toughest challenges here at home and get Michigan's economy moving again.",Issue Position: Iraq
0,Gary Peters,"Personally and in public service, education has always been a passion of mine. I learned the importance of an education early in my life. My father was public school teacher for over 25 years and he instilled in me a love of learning. He also taught me the necessity of passing on what we have learned to the next generation.Just as our auto industry must adapt to a rapidly changing global economy, our children must be prepared to thrive in the new and challenging global economy.We must give our children the tools necessary to compete in a fierce global marketplace and we must ensure that they have the skills necessary for the American economy to thrive.As a State Senator, I served as the ranking member of the Senate Education Committee and I continually fought for policies that would expand educational opportunities for all children regardless of where they lived. I was particularly troubled by the fact that many schools in my Senate district lacked Internet access. In order to rectify this problem I formed a grassroots organization called NetDay Michigan and we mobilized hundreds of volunteers to roll up their sleeves, pull wire and install donated computers. We wired twenty-two schools, libraries and recreation centers and in the process opened a world of opportunities for children who would not otherwise have access to the Internet and a computer.In Congress, I believe we must make a national commitment to preK-12 education. We must fully fund early childhood education programs, equip our classrooms with cutting edge technology, strengthen science and technology curriculums, demand higher standards, reduce class size and make sure that we have the best trained, most qualified teachers in the world. And, we must also never neglect the unique needs of children in our special education programs.Too often, the makers of education policy in Washington are out of touch with the changing job market, the needs of our children and the increasing demands placed on our teachers. As an experienced educator and policy maker, I look forward to shaking up the status quo in Congress.",Issue Position: Education
0,Gary Peters,"Every American should have the opportunity for a safe and secure retirement after a lifetime of hard work. Economic conditions are causing older workers to put off retirement plans, retirees are thinking about going back to work, current workers are reducing 401(k) contributions and more are borrowing from their retirement savings to pay for basic necessities.Today's middle-class families feel the strain of paying for increasing health care costs, mounting college tuition bills, skyrocketing day care fees and higher energy prices. The current economic crisis has highlighted existing weaknesses in the 401(k) retirement savings systememployers face bankruptcy. These realities make saving for retirement an even greater challenge. Many Americans are also facing the alarming prospect of finding their pensions increasingly at risk as large.We must strengthen retirement security and protect workers' 401(k) plans without adding to the deficit. We also cannot sacrifice the guaranteed benefit of Social Security and Medicare. These enduring programs provide workers with security in their retirement; we must see that they are available not just to us and our parents, but to our children and grandchildren. I will fight to make sure that every American has the opportunity to build and enjoy secure retirement and do everything possible to help middle-class families prepare for a brighter future.Social SecuritySocial Security is one of the most successful programs of the 20th century, and we must preserve this promise for future generations. Social Security has provided workers and their families a guaranteed base of financial security in their retirement years since its inception over 70 years ago. This program is a safety net for retirees, disabled workers and survivors, and it provides guaranteed benefits to workers.Without Social Security, a majority of American seniors would be facing poverty; with it, 90 percent of seniors are kept out of poverty. Social Security provides the majority of income for 6 out of 10 seniors, and it is the only source of income for 20 percent of elderly Americans. It also provides life and disability insurance.The importance of Social Security income to seniors cannot be overstated, and I am deeply concerned about the Social Security Administration's announcement that there will be no cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for 2010 for the first time in decades. Many Michigan seniors have seen their retirement savings shrink and are now struggling to afford their medications and pay their bills. While the Social Security Administration will not be providing a COLA in 2010, I firmly believe that Congress should and must act. I have cosponsored legislation to provide Social Security recipients with a one-time adjusted payment this year, and I am pleased that President Obama has endorsed providing a $250 payment to Social Security recipients in 2010.In addition to ensuring that Social Security recipients are able to make ends meet in the short term, we currently face the challenge of preserving this essential program for future generations. Though the solvency of Social Security is an important, long-term concern, it does not merit rash, dangerous solutions. Social Security should not be privatized as proposed by President Bush. Had we done this as proposed in 2005, many seniors would've seen their benefits decimated as stocks plummeted as a result of the recent financial crisis. While Social Security does face long-term challenges that need to be addressed, these can be fixed with more sensible changes to the system. According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO), Social Security can pay all benefits until 2052. We must act to maintain Social Security, but we should not act rashly in a way that would expose too many seniors to a potential major loss in benefits when the market tanks. I will continue to work to ensure that Social Security remains solvent for generations to come.MedicareLike Social Security, Medicare is an essential institution that we must protect. Millions of Americans have had their lives changed for the better because of these initiatives. With large numbers of baby boomers preparing to retire in the next five to ten years, we must work to ensure that Social Security and Medicare remain solvent.Medicare is critical to providing older Americans with the security knowing that as they age, they can rest assured that they will have access to health care. This is especially true in this tough economy. I am committed to the long-term strength of the Medicare program.We must reduce waste in the Medicare system. I support efforts to eliminate subsidies to the private insurance Medicare Advantage program. By cutting out the private insurer middle men, we can make Medicare more efficient and get the most patient care for every taxpayer dollar spent.We also must tackle fundamental health care reform to improve the quality and efficiency of our healthcare system and strengthen Medicare. I supported the Affordable Health Care for America Act (H.R. 3962), which would reduce drug prices for seniors that fall in the ""donut hole"" of Medicare Part D coverage, eliminate co-pays on preventative care for Medicare recipients, and cover preventative services like diabetes and cancer screenings free of charge. We must work to enhance and strengthen Medicare so that our nation's senior citizens do not need to choose between basic necessities and the health care they need.Saving for RetirementFamilies are struggling to meet their needs, facing rising health care costs, increasingly expensive tuition, skyrocketing day care bills and high energy prices. It is tougher and tougher to adequately save for retirement. At the same time, a number of company pension plans are at risk, making a secure retirement all the more difficult to achieve. In order to minimize these risks, we must begin real pension reform to protect employees and their pensions from CEO corruption and mismanagement. We must prevent companies from unfairly dumping pension plans and make certain that employees receive the benefits they have been promised after a lifetime of hard work.Effective reforms of the financial industry will provide stability to families' retirement savings. As a member of the House Committee on Financial services, I had the opportunity to help craft H.R. 4173, Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which the House passed in December 2009. This legislation will enact the most comprehensive financial reforms since the Great Depression and will protect our retirement and college savings from unnecessary risks and stop pay practices that encourage executives to take excessive risk at the expense of their companies and shareholders.In addition to pension and Wall Street reform, we also must strengthen the integrity of Social Security. This is why I oppose the GOP plan to privatize Social Security. I strongly support securing social security's long-term stability and solvency. The Republican plan to create private accounts in Social Security would have been disastrous, causing many seniors to see drastic losses as a result of the recent financial crisis. While protecting Social Security is critical, it is not enough for ensuring that every American has a secure retirement. We need to encourage saving and provide working families with the tools they need to achieve their financial goals for retirement, such as lifetime savings accounts. We could also dramatically increase the number of people investing in 401(k) accounts by encouraging employers to automatically enroll eligible employees into these types of retirement plans unless the employee chooses not to participate. Finally, we must make certain that retirees' individual retirement accounts (IRAs) and 401(k)s are secure.",Issue Position: Retirement Security

0,Gary Peters,"The United States should have two goals: to maintain the best equipped and best trained fighting force in the world, and to use it as sparingly as possible. As a former Lieutenant Commander in the U.S. Navy Reserve who served in the Persian Gulf in support of Operation Southern Watch and again served overseas following the September 11th terrorist attacks, and as the son of a World War II veteran, I understand the sacrifices that military families make on behalf of our nation.That is why I believe it is our solemn duty to make sure that when our servicemen and women go into harms way they do so with the equipment and training they need to safely return. Our commitment to these brave men and women cannot be limited to supporting them when they are overseas. The insufficient care uncovered at Walter Reed and other military hospitals is inexcusable, and I am committed to ensuring that men and women returning from combat have access to the best care and services we can provide.Creating peace and security in the Middle East must be one of our nation's top foreign policy objectives. To accomplish this, the U.S. must be a strong ally and supporter of Israel. Our nation must be actively engaged in the region, more so than we have been in the last eight years, and I will work to ensure that happens.Responsibly Ending the War in IraqThe War in Iraq has now gone on longer than any American conflict other than Vietnam, and has cost more than any conflict other than World War II. The debate over whether or not we should have gone to war in Iraq is long over, and the question is now whether vital American interests are protected by our continued presence there. The men and women who have served in Iraq have done an admirable job under less than ideal conditions, but repeated deployments are taking their toll on our readiness and ability to respond to other vital threats.That is why I support the President's plan to responsibly withdraw our troops and turn over the task of securing Iraq to the Iraqis. After conducting a comprehensive strategy review and consulting with top military and civilian leadership in Iraq and in Washington, President Obama has announced plans to withdraw most American combat troops by September 2010, with the remaining forces removed by the end of 2011.The best way to ensure that American troops can be brought home as quickly as possible is to make sure that Iraqi troops are properly trained and equipped. That is why I supported legislation that permits the Secretary of Defense to transfer certain equipment to the Iraqi Security Forces to ensure that those forces can address internal security challenges in Iraq on their own and permit U.S. forces to responsibly redeploy.Peace and Security for Israel and the Middle EastIn 1948, the United States became the first nation to recognize Israel's independence, just eleven minutes after it was declared by Prime Minister David Ben Gurion. Ever since, the United States and Israel have shared a special relationship, one rooted in the common values of democracy, respect for the rule of law, and pluralism. Support for Israel has long been a bedrock principal of American foreign policy, and I will work in Congress to ensure that the US-Israel relationship continues to grow stronger and that it remains non-partisan.Unfortunately, the United States and Israel have also shared a common struggle against terrorism over the past decade, and both nations must be vigilant to prevent nuclear proliferation by rogue states and terrorist organizations. Having twice visited Israel, I understand the precarious nature of its security and the need for peace and stability in the region. Israel's security is non-negotiable and in the vital interest of the United States. That is why I voted to support Israel's right to self-defense in response to armed threats from Hamas and why I have co-sponsored legislation that will increase sanctions on Iran.I also believe Israel's security is enhanced by a strong U.S. engagement in the region and that a secure Israel, with recognized and defensible borders, and a peaceful resolution to the conflict is in the long-term interest of all parties.One of the biggest threats to Israel, as well to the entire region remains Iran, whose hostile anti-democratic government continues to pursue nuclear weapons in violation of international law. That is why I am a strong supporter of sanctions against Iran, and why I have cosponsored legislation such as the Iran Refined Petroleum Sanctions Act and the Iran Sanctions Enabling Act and am happy that both bills have passed the House and hope that a final bill will soon be signed into law. Keeping Our Promise to America's VeteransServing in the Armed Forces of the United States is one of the greatest gifts one can give to our country, and in return our country's promise to our servicemen and women is one of our most sacred covenants. Whether America is at peace or at war, our service members protect our country and provide us the freedom that makes the United States a great nation. That is why I will continue to fight to ensure that our veterans and military retirees receive all of the support and care they have earned, and that they return to their families with pride and honor.As a former Lt. Commander in the Naval Reserve, I understand that it is no longer just those who sign up for active-duty service that are deployed to combat zones. I will fight for the extension of medical and education benefits to all of our nation's service members who are deployed, regardless of whether they enlisted as active duty, reserve or National Guard. As the son of a World War II veteran, I understand how important it is that our heroes return home to an America of opportunity. That is why I have supported a tax credit for small businesses that hire returned veterans. We must also continue to ensure the Veterans' Administration is properly funded, running efficiently and is providing quality service to those who defended us. After years of neglect, it has become clear that the Veterans' Administration is not serving our veterans as well as they have served us. I was proud to support measures to allow the Veterans' Administration to digitize records and provide for increased funding to treat Traumatic Brain Injuries and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, the signature wounds of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The problems facing the VA affect all of our veterans. For some, this has meant waiting in a claims backlog a million entries long. For others, it has meant falling through the cracks while wounds go untreated. I was proud to cosponsor advanced appropriations legislation to provide for more predictable VA funding and legislation to reduce the VA claims backlog, and am working with the Department of Defense and the Veterans' Administration to ensure that service members in need of care are properly screened to receive the treatment they need. Important as it is to express our respect, it takes more than kind words to truly honor our veterans. I look forward to continuing to bring the Veterans' Administration into the 21st Century, and will not stop until I am satisfied that our Veterans come home to an America with access to the education, employment and health care they so fully deserve.",Issue Position: Veterans and Foreign Affairs
0,Gary Peters,"One of Congress' most important responsibilities is to protect taxpayers by reducing waste and keeping government spending under control. We must restore honest, transparent accounting and get serious about addressing our budget deficit head on. We need to cut government waste, stop corporations from hiding their money in overseas tax shelters and responsibly end the Iraq War. We also need to enact strong Pay-as-you-go legislation to force Congress to reign in spending by requiring that any new spending proposed be paid for elsewhere in the budget rather than through borrowing. Congress should also create a bipartisan debt commission to identify budget reforms necessary to balance the budget over the long-term. If Congress does these things, we can balance the budget and reduce America's debt while cutting middle class and small business taxes and continuing to make critical investments for long-term job creation.I believe we must also protect taxpayers by ensuring that Americans never again finance a Wall Street bailout, and are repaid every penny of the bailout Congress and the Bush Adminstration created in 2008. I am very proud to have authored legislation that passed the House to ensure that the TARP program, also known as the Wall Street bailout, does not cost taxpayers one cent.In December 2009, the House of Representatives passed the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (H.R. 4173). This comprehensive legislation reins in out of control Wall Street bonuses and executive compensation schemes that lead to excessive risk taking. It ensures that there will be no more bailouts of ""Too Big to Fail"" financial institutions by giving regulators the power to identify which large, interconnected institutions pose systemic risk to the larger economy and subjecting them to heightened oversight and by giving the government the authority to unwind failing institutions in an orderly fashion so they do not threaten the entire economy.H.R. 4173 also contained an amendment I authored which ensures that taxpayers will not be on the hook for a single penny of the TARP program, also known as the Wall Street bailout. My amendment requires the same large financial institutions that caused the financial crisis to pay for any shortfalls in the $700 billion TARP program.As a state senator, I ran my office so efficiently that I returned a full year's operating budget to the people of Michigan over the course of my tenure. I am now bringing this same philosophy to Washington. I ran my Congressional office significantly under budget in 2009, saving taxpayers tens of thousands of dollars. Renewing Congress' commitment to fiscal responsibility will allow us to move toward a balanced budget and focus on investing in what is important to families in Michigan and across the United States, such as job creation, stronger schools, better roads and advanced technology vehicle production while providing tax relief to working families and small businesses.-New Tax Cuts I Supported-My Legislation to Cut Taxes-Cracking Down on Fraud and Offshore Tax Havens-Reducing Wasteful SpendingNew Tax Cuts I SupportedA strong middle class is necessary for a strong America. Working families need and deserve tax relief, and I am proud to have voted for the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (a.k.a. the stimulus bill), which provided the quickest, broadest tax cut in U.S. history. The Recovery Act provides 95% of Americans with a tax break, while also expanding the refundable child tax credit and providing small business tax incentives to business to create jobs and spur investment.During tough economic times, tax relief is critical to both easing the burden facing middle class families and jumpstarting the economy. Hard working, middle class families are taking home more money in every paycheck. Nearly four million Michigan residents are benefitting from this tax cut.To create new jobs in Michigan, we must make it easier for small businesses to grow. I supported tens of billions of dollars in tax cuts for businesses making capital investments, targeted tax cuts to keep struggling businesses afloat and proposed a plan to redirect Wall Street bailout funds to help provide small business loans instead.To help boost sagging home values, I supported an $8,000 tax credit for first time homebuyers to help reduce the glut of homes on the market. Tens of thousands of Michigan residents took advantage of this credit to purchase new homes. When the credit was set to expire on December 1 of last year, I fought to have it extended until May 2010, and expanded to provide a credit for existing homebuyers to purchase new homes as well.I supported a similar provision to boost auto sales by creating a deduction of sales tax on new cars purchases, expected to generate nearly 100,000 new car sales this year. I am also proud to have cosponsored and voted for legislation enacting the popular ""Cash for Clunkers"" program. The Car Allowance Rebate System gave car buyers rebates of up to $4,500 if they traded in less fuel-efficient vehicles for new vehicles that met certain fuel efficiency requirements. This effective program helped sell hundreds of thousands of efficient vehicles, boosting the economy, creating jobs, reducing emissions, and helping thousands of families afford a new vehicle.Finally, I fought to shield middle class taxpayers from the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT). The AMT was originally intended to only apply to the very wealthiest Americans and prevent them from using loopholes to circumvent paying all federal taxes. Because it was never indexed for inflation, the AMT would have burdened over 25 million middle class taxpayers if Congress had failed to act this year. I urged House and Senate leadership to include AMT relief for the middle class in the economic recovery plan. Leadership responded and included the fix in the recovery plan, stopping the AMT from hitting thousands of Oakland County residents a tax increase this year.Return to TopLegislation I Authored to Cut TaxesI have made cutting taxes for middle class families a top priority because rising expenses and stagnant wages are squeezing the middle class like never before. That is why two of the first bills that I introduced as a United States Congressman, the Helping Families Afford to Work Act and the Helping Families Afford Tuition Act, are critical tax cuts for the middle class.The Helping Families Afford to Work Act increases and expands the Dependent Care Tax Credit (DCTC) to help working families afford quality child care. The Act would provide an annual tax credit of up to $6,000 to help offset the rapidly rising cost of child care. While the cost of child care has risen rapidly since President Reagan signed the credit into law in 1981, the value of the DCTC has largely remained stagnant and actually decreased dramatically when adjusted for inflation. In fact, the average price of full-time center day care in the U.S. increased at almost twice the rate of inflation in recent years. The average Michigan family now spends between $6,032 and $8,996 a year for child care. Meanwhile, because the DCTC has not kept pace with inflation, it is now worth less than half its original value.Some parents are finding that child care costs are so high they can barely afford to work. That's why I introduced the Helping Families Afford to Work Act to provide a tax cut for families to offset the rapidly rising cost of child care. This is a necessary, common sense bill that provides relief to middle class families and stimulates the economy by allowing families to keep and spend more of their own money. I was pleased to see President Obama call to expand the DCTC during his State of the Union Address, and I will continue fighting to provide this important tax relief for middle class families.The Helping Families Afford Tuition Act provides up to a $5,000 per student tax credit for tuition and related expenses for up to five years of post secondary education. Rapidly rising tuition costs have increasingly become a significant barrier for students seeking a college education. With this legislation, we have an opportunity to invest in our nation's students, relieve the financial burden middle class families face in sending their children to college, and help our next generation of workers compete in the global economy.Return to TopCracking Down on Fraud and Offshore Tax HavensOffshore tax havens and secrecy jurisdictions currently hold trillions of dollars in assets, and some of these havens are allowing corporations to hide billions of dollars and avoid paying their fair share in taxes. If we crackdown on these havens, we can reduce the deficit, provide major tax relief for honest taxpayers and make key job creating investments in our country.International professionals including tax attorneys, bankers, brokers, trust administrators, accountants, and corporate service providers have created an intricate offshore industry that aggressively promotes offshore jurisdictions as a means for large corporations to avoid paying taxes in their home jurisdictions. These professionals, many of whom are located or do business in the United States, advise and assist corporations and wealthy individuals on opening offshore accounts, establishing shell corporations and sham trusts, hiding assets in offshore jurisdictions, and making secret use of their offshore assets here at home. Experts estimate that the U.S. loses between $70 and $100 billion in taxes each year through the use of these illegal offshore tax schemes.That is why I have cosponsored the Stop Tax Haven Abuse Act. This bill, sponsored by Senator Carl Levin, will crack down on the use of offshore tax havens. These abuses rob honest taxpayers of an estimated $100 billion every year. The bill intends to stop tax haven abuse through a multi-pronged approach: increasing penalties for using tax havens, increasing the IRS's ability to prosecute tax shelter abuses, increasing penalties and enforcement of tax shelter promoters and tightening economic substance rules. Simply enforcing the current tax code and requiring corporations to pay their taxes just like honest families will allow us to cut the deficit, provide tax breaks for middle class families that need them and make job creating investments here at home.Return to TopReducing Wasteful SpendingCongress holds the purse strings of the federal government and therefore has the duty to be good stewards of the taxpayers' money. It is important to the national economy that our government spends wisely. On every issue our nation faces, it is our responsibility to ensure that the policies we pursue are consistent with the values held by the people we represent.I believe that we must invest responsibly on priorities such as job creation, education and social security. And reducing unnecessary spending will allow us to continue to cut taxes for small businesses and hardworking families, while shrinking the massive budget deficit built up over the past decade. I have worked with my colleagues in both parties to control budget deficits and fight the growth of our national debt, and I have voted against Democratic leadership to oppose hundreds of billions of dollars in spending since coming to Congress in January 2009. Currently, our debt's cost is one of the fastest growing expenses in the federal budget. We must reduce our national debt by returning to smart, responsible fiscal policies. By doing this we can not only cut the deficit, but one day return to the budget surpluses enjoyed in the late 1990s.We must ensure that new tax cuts and spending commitments are paid for without burdening our children and grandchildren with excessive debt. I believe that a crucial step in restoring fiscal discipline and reducing wasteful spending is the enforcement of pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) budgeting rules which require new spending commitments or tax changes to be paid for by cuts to other programs or new revenue--rather than simply borrowing the money and adding to our debt. That's why I cosponsored legislation to make PAYGO law.While enacting PAYGO is a step in the right direction, we must work aggressively to shrink our budget deficit. We need a comprehensive plan in place for controlling spending and charting a path to shrink our national debt in the long-term. I support the creation of a bipartisan debt commission that would recommend a comprehensive package of spending cuts to be voted on by Congress. I was one of only 19 members of my party to vote to cap discretionary spending in July of last year, and I am pleased that President Obama announced his support for this idea in January. I will continue voting against unnecessary spending and working with my colleagues to find ways to cut waste and shrink our nation's deficits.",Issue Position: Protecting Taxpayers

0,Gary Peters,"As we work to get our economy back on track, we must realize that education is a central component of economic development. If America does not lead the world in education, our future workforce will be less productive and less globally competitive. I am committed to a strong public education system that provides children with the skills they need to succeed in the 21st century economy. That means access to quality public schools for all children and an affordable college education for all who pursue one. As a member of the Science and Technology Committee, I recognize the need to bolster science, technology, engineering, and math programs in our public school system. These investments benefit our children now and strengthen America's long-term economic success.Investing in our Public SchoolsA healthy public education system is critical to ensuring America's children grow up with the skills they need to be competitive in the 21st century global economy. Many states are facing severe budget shortfalls and have already been forced to make cuts to K-12 education. Federal action was necessary to help ensure the recession did not cause our children's education to suffer. That's why I voted to bring over $3 billion in investments to Michigan's schools, $52 million for Oakland County schools alone, through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (also known as the stimulus bill). In order to provide relief to local schools and ease the burden on state budgets, the ARRA provided federal IDEA and Title 1 grants as well as investments in school modernization construction and direct help to local school districts with budget shortfalls through State Stabilization fund. While some see education and economic development as separate issues, I believe they are one in the same. The education investments in the economic recovery plan will create new jobs now make America's workforce more globally competitive.One of the most important pieces of legislation affecting K-12 education, the ""No Child Left Behind Act"" (NCLB,) will come up for reauthorization this year. While the original goals of improving student achievement and holding schools and teachers to tougher accountability standards should be maintained, the Act has put an underfunded federal mandate on our local districts for years and significant modifications to the legislation are needed to fully achieve its goals. I support changes that maintain original goals of NCLB while also easing the burden of unfunded mandates, revising Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) standards and sanctions and providing reasonable flexibility to states and local schools.Fighting for Local SchoolsA difficult State budget environment has affected all residents, and schools have been especially hard hit. Michigan's FY10 School aid budget included a $165 per pupil cut, and a $51 million cut for 41 districts knows as ""20j"" districts. The 20j cuts were particularly painful for Michigan's 9th District, hitting 7 local districts and amounting to over $10 million in cuts. In response to 20j and additional education cuts, I contacted State leaders raising concerns about the loss of federal monies that could occur if the State education cuts remain.

Gary Peters supports closing tax loopholes that reward corporations that ship jobs overseas while sticking U.S. taxpayers with the bill. Scare taxpayer resources should not encourage the exportation of our jobs. Instead, the U.S. should reward companies that hire American workers and invest in new equipment here at home. Under Peters plan, companies that add workers to pay roll or invest in new facilities in America would see an immediate tax reduction paid for by the elimination of tax breaks for outsourcing.When GM and Chrysler were threatened with bankruptcy, Peters stood up to those in Washington who would have simply let the American Auto industry collapse and slip into history. He was a national leader in standing up to the big banks who were trying to profit by forcing Chrysler into liquidation. When GM announced they were shutting down the Lake Orion plant, Gary Peters launched the Make it in Michigan campaign and 30,000 people joined the fight. The effort was so successful that instead of closing the plant, it helped convince GM to become the first automaker to build a subcompact car here in America. His leadership helped save thousands of jobs in Oakland County by protecting two General Motors plants from permanent shutdown and saving Chrysler from liquidation. Now American auto companies have started to bounce back and have begun to create jobs again in our community.Peters was also a leader in the effort to boost the economy through the Cash for Clunkers program, which provided consumers a rebate for trading in older, low mileage vehicles in order to purchase new fuel efficient models. The program spurred the sale of 700,000 new cars and increased overall GDP, giving our industry and economy a badly needed boost. Peters fought for a Clunkers program in which only North American built cars could participate, but some said that would violate international trade rules. Of course, Japan later announced that its Cash for Clunkers program would effectively bar American vehicles. This is exactly the sort of outrageously unfair trade policy that has cost Michigan so many jobs. Peters has assembled a coalition of other Members of Congress to stand up to Japan and force them to play by the rules and allow American cars to compete with theirs on a level playing field.Peters' Plan to Fight Outsourcing and Support Michigan's Auto Industry will:* Eliminate tax breaks that encourage companies to ship jobs overseas;* Provide immediate tax credits for employers that hire unemployed workers;* Provide tax incentives for companies that expand or build new facilities in Michigan and across the country;* Fight for fair trade policies that level the playing field for our workers;* Enforce trade agreements and crack down on Chinese currency manipulation.",Issue Position: Creating Jobs - Fighting Outsourcing and Supporting Michigan's Auto Industry

0,Gary Peters,"Our auto companies have been held to strict accountability standards as a condition for receiving government support. It is true that if our auto companies are receiving tax dollars they need to be accountable to taxpayers. However, Wall Street--and our government, for that matter--do not seem to think they need to be equally accountable to taxpayers. I believe that Wall Street financial firms and the government must be held to similarly tough criterion--no double standards. That's why I'm fighting to hold large banks and hedge funds accountable for their actions which pushed our economy to the brink and ensure they cannot endanger our economy again. I also authored legislation to guarantee that large financial firms pay back every penny of their bailout to taxpayers, and am fighting to end government bailouts in the future and make the federal government more open, transparent and accountable for our tax dollars.-Common Sense Rules for Wall Street-Transparency and Accountability in GovernmentCommon Sense Rules for Wall StreetAfter hearing story after story about Wall Street firms giving millions in bonuses to the very people who helped create the financial crisis, many expressed their outrage. It's not enough to simply talk about the egregiousness of these bonuses; it is also incumbent upon Congress to do something. I co-authored legislation to recover egregious bonuses to return them to taxpayers. This is a common-sense approach that constitutional scholars agree is legally sound. That's why the House passed the bill by a bipartisan three-to-one margin and why so many Americans are behind this action.But the larger issue is whether financial executives who caused this economic crisis will be allowed to continue business as usual. As a condition of receiving federal support, auto companies were forced to restructure to ensure long-term viability. The same should have been required of financial institutions last year. Since coming to Congress, one of my top priorities has been reforming the financial sector to protect taxpayers, get our economy moving and ensure the industry cannot wreak havoc on our economy in the future.In December 2009, the House of Representatives passed the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (H.R. 4173). This comprehensive legislation reins in out of control Wall Street bonuses and executive compensation schemes that lead to excessive risk taking. It ensures that there will be no more bailouts of ""Too Big to Fail"" financial institutions by giving regulators the power to identify which large, interconnected institutions pose systemic risk to the larger economy and subjecting them to heightened oversight and by giving the government the authority to unwind failing institutions in an orderly fashion so they do not threaten the entire economy. The legislation creates a new Consumer Financial Protection Agency that will shine light on currently unregulated entities like mortgage brokers and payday lenders and provide important protections for consumers in the mortgage market by banning deceptive practices and requiring lenders to offer loans only to customers with a demonstrated ability to repay. The Wall Street Reform Act also regulates the over the counter (OTC) derivatives market. Abuse of these products by AIG and Wall Street investment firms and hedge funds contributed significantly to the recent financial meltdown and ensuing economic crisis.The Wall Street Reform Act also contained an amendment I authored which ensures that taxpayers will not be on the hook for a single penny of TARP program, also known as the Wall Street bailout. My amendment requires the same large financial institutions that caused the financial crisis to pay for any shortfalls in the $700 billion TARP program.Congress has already acted to protect consumers against some of the worst practices by passing into law the Credit Cardholders Bill of Rights (H.R. 627). This legislation protects consumers from hidden fees, arbitrary rate changes and other egregious practices. This legislation also included language contained in a common sense amendment that I offered which would require that consumers' payments be applied to the portion of their balance with the highest interest rate first. Previously, a credit card company could require a consumer to pay off all other debt before they allowed the principle with the highest interest rate be paid, unfairly costing consumers money.I have also authored legislation called the Shareholder Empowerment Act (H.R. 2861) that would allow shareholders--a company's true owners--to vote on executive pay and require the use of independent compensation advisors to make objective recommendations on executive pay. My plan gives shareholders the right to deny golden parachutes to executives who do not perform, and gives them greater authority to recoup bonuses awarded on the basis of fraudulent earnings data.I was an advocate of these reforms long before outrage exploded over AIG's bonuses. We needed to act to return AIG bonuses to taxpayers, but we must go further to restructure the financial industry. This is central to getting our economy growing again, and protecting folks on Main Street from getting burned by Wall Street.Return to TopTransparency and Accountability in GovernmentA democracy only functions properly when there is vigilant oversight to continuously make government more transparent, ethical and accountable, and to create vigorous oversight mechanisms to prevent abuse and protect tax dollars. That's why I voted for tough standards to prevent waste and fraud in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (a.k.a. the stimulus bill). The Recovery Act includes protection of whistleblowers who report waste and a website, www.recovery.gov, to disclose all information on government contracts and spending. No earmarks or pet projects were allowed in the plan and the Recovery Act Accountability and Transparency Board will review management of recovery dollars to ensure they are used efficiently.To further protect tax dollars, I called for a congressional pay freeze and co-sponsored H.R. 156, the Stop the Congressional Pay Raise Act of 2009, to prevent Members of Congress from receiving a pay increase until at least 2011. Members of Congress should not receive a pay increase while so many Americans are taking pay cuts or losing their incomes altogether. The pay freeze proposed last year has now become law, and I have now cosponsored additional legislation to prevent a pay increase until at least 2012.In addition to protecting taxpayer dollars, I believe that transparency is at the foundation of good government. Legislation should be available to the public to read and review before Congress votes. I urged House leadership to post the final health care reform bill for at least 72 hours before a final vote, and they have agreed to do so. I will continue to fight for transparent government that is accountable to taxpayers.",Issue Position: Oversight and Accountability

But the spiraling costs of health care are crippling our businesses and putting an incredible strain on families facing financial ruin if someone loses their job or gets sick.The health care system we currently have focuses on the wrong priorities, putting the profits of the big drug and insurance companies before the health of patients. We need to turn that around, returning the focus of our health care system to patients and their doctors, not big corporate interests.One of my first priorities in Washington will be making sure that every American has access to affordable, high-quality health care and the choice of a family doctor they trust, a plan they choose, and coverage that can't be taken away if someone changes jobs or gets laid off.No one can promise that sending one new person to Congress will achieve this level of universal coverage over night. That's not going to happen. But if we send the right kinds of people there - leaders committed to getting started on day one, standing up to the special interests and speaking out for working families - we'll get there.And we're going to do that by reducing costs, expanding on what works, providing help for small businesses, and giving all Americans access to the same type of coverage Congress receives:Reduce Costs. The high cost of health care in this country is great if you're the CEO of a company that makes the medicine we rely on, or sit on the board of an insurance company making record profits. But it's devastating for the everyday families and small businesses that depend on it. Making health care more accessible means making it more affordable:* Lower Rx Drug Costs. We must allow the government to use its purchasing power to negotiate for lower drug costs and permit the re-importation of safe, proven medicine from countries like Canada. Drug companies are charging Americans twice as much for the same medicine they sell in Europe and Canada. Our government is letting them get away with it, and that's wrong. Lower prices will lead to lower premiums.* Emphasize Prevention. It costs less to keep someone from getting sick than to treat them after they've fallen ill.* Modernize Our Medicine. We can eliminate bureaucratic waste by implementing cost-saving mechanisms such as electronic records and delivery.Expand On What Works. SCHIP (known as MIchild here in Michigan) and Medicaid are the all too rare examples of government programs that work. Rather than cutting them as President Bush and Congressman Knollenberg would do, we should be expanding them to extend the promise of affordable care to Michigan children and families.Help For Small Businesses. The small businessmen I talk to as I travel Oakland County want to do the right thing by their employees. They want to provide health care, but the costs are so high they can't afford to. Small businesses like these should be our partners, and the government should be helping them do the right thing by offering tax credits for businesses that offer health care to their employees and helping them to lower their costs and increase their purchasing power by giving them the option to join together and buy their insurance together.Open the Congressional Model To All Americans. Our tax dollars pay for Members of Congress and their families to have access to the best health care coverage available, offering choices of modern benefits and private plans, providing comprehensive information to enrollees, and controlling costs while constantly improving benefits and enjoying wide popularity. There's no reason this model can't be expanded and opened to all Americans, and I look forward to working with a new Democratic President to make that a reality.Affordable health care that's accessible to everyone is critical to the health of Michigan's families and essential to the competitiveness of our businesses. It means standing up to the special interests and speaking out for working families. We're going to have to work together, one step at a time, and we're not going to get there over night.

0,Gary Peters,"Government must live within its means. Reckless government spending and irresponsible fiscal management have undermined our economy, weakened the dollar, and driven up costs for American families and businesses alike.As a financial manager for over twenty years, other people trusted me with their money, and they expected me to invest it wisely. Our representatives in government should treat the taxpayers' money as responsibly as they would treat their own savings.That's what I did in the Michigan Senate, where I managed my office budget so carefully that I was able to return the equivalent of a full-year's operating budget. Later, when I took over the Michigan Lottery, I again cut wasteful spending and brought the lottery in under budget every year.Unfortunately, the Bush Administration and its supporters in Congress like Joe Knollenberg have been terrible stewards of our tax dollars. When President Bush took office, our national debt was $5.7 trillion. This June, it crossed $9.4 trillion, and the interest on our debt now costs us well over $1 billion every single day. To put that in perspective, ten cents out of every dollar Michigan families paid in taxes last year went to paying the interest on our federal debt.It is not just our children and grandchildren who will face the consequences of this irresponsible spending spree.

0,Gary Peters,"The American health care industry must be reformed.Since 1999, health insurance premiums have risen considerably faster than both the inflation rate and our wages. As a result of these rapidly escalating costs, increasing numbers of American families are being forced to go without the coverage they need to protect the health of their loved ones. Today, one in six Americans do not have health insurance and without this critical protection many families are only one serious illness away from bankruptcy. issues_healthcareUninsured families are not the only ones being hurt by our current health care system. Rapidly escalating health care costs put American businesses at a significant competitive disadvantage versus global competitors located in countries with national health care systems and as a result good paying jobs are being lost.

0,Gary Peters,"This is one of the most challenging times Michigan has faced in its 162-year history. Americans are struggling across the country, and we in Michigan have been facing a recession longer than any other state. Getting our economy back on track must be job one and is my central focus every day. To do that, we must create the conditions to allow Michigan's entrepreneurs to grow and create jobs and provide relief for Michigan families. That means we must: cut taxes for small businesses and middle class families, get loans to small businesses flowing again, invest in new hi-tech industries, preserve and modernize our auto industry and create fair trade policies that allow Michigan workers and businesses to compete and succeed in the global economy. Our people have faced down great challenges in the past, and if we enact sound policies that support our workers and business owners, Michigan will again become the global economic engine as it has been in the past.* Supporting Small Businesses * Creating New Manufacturing Jobs and Investing in 21st Century Auto Technology * Supporting our Domestic Automobile Industry * Economic Recovery Act * Protecting Home Values * Fair Trade for American Workers and BusinessesSupporting Small BusinessesCreating the environment that allows small businesses to grow is critical to creating jobs and reducing Michigan's unemployment rate. Small businesses employ half of all private sector employees and are responsible for creating created 60-80% of all new jobs over the last decade. By serving as a platform for new ideas and new investment, small businesses create thousands of new, local jobs that will be central to Michigan's economic recovery. That is why fighting to give entrepreneurs the tools they need to succeed will always be one of my top priorities.Our current financial crisis has adversely affected every sector of our economy, and small business is no exception. Frozen credit markets can make it impossible to get a loan to start a new business or expand an existing one. In November, I convened a field hearing in which Members of Congress traveled to Southeast Michigan to hear directly from small business owners and experts on Michigan entrepreneurs lack of access to affordable credit. The following month, I voted against the jobs bill introduced by House leadership because it lacked sufficient support for small businesses. I then advanced my own plan calling for $40 billion in unspent Wall Street bailout funds to be redirected to provide small business loans. In January, the President announced he endorsed the use of Wall Street bailout funding for small businesses instead.To specifically help areas as hard hit as Michigan, I wrote an amendment to the Small Business Financing and Investment Act (H.R. 3854) that would provide up to $70,000 in zero interest loans with more favorable repayment terms to areas with high unemployment. My amendment will also make high-unemployment areas eligible for the New Market Venture Capital Program, providing extra incentive to invest in places such as Oakland County that have extra need.I also supported provisions in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (also known as the stimulus bill) that provided $13 billion in loans, lines of credit and capital for small firms to provide a financial market that is friendly to small businesses. To further free up the lending market, the Obama Administration recently proposed the release of $15 billion of TARP funds to create a secondary market for SBA loans. This will allow banks to get credit flowing to small businesses and I fully support this plan.In Oakland County, we are painfully aware of the effects that the Wall Street crisis has had on our economy. I believe that part of making sure Wall Street doesn't disrupt our economy again means making sure that local banks are able to lend in Oakland County. I am also a strong believer that we need to encourage private-sector small business lending in an effort to create an environment in which those with good ideas who will work hard can access the capital they need to succeed. I am an original cosponsor of legislation that would expand the Small Business Administration's Express Loan Program, which allows local banks a greater deal of discretion in lending to small businesses in the community and cuts down on the time and red tape in between local entrepreneurs and the capital they need to revitalize our economy.The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act contains additional measures supporting small businesses. The Recovery Act will invest $7.2 billion in IT infrastructure, which over 100 high-tech CEO's have said will create hundreds of thousands of new jobs--more than half of which will be in small businesses. The Recovery Act also provides small businesses with $30 billion in tax relief, targeted to spur investment and job creation.By giving entrepreneurs the tools they need to survive the difficult economy and thrive in the years ahead, small business will continue to be the engine of US job creation, strengthen our communities and develop the products and services that will ensure America continues to lead in the 21st century.Return to TopCreating New Manufacturing Jobs and Investing in 21st Century TechnologyA healthy manufacturing base is critical to the security of the American middle class and must be a key component of our economic recovery. In order to maintain competitiveness in the global marketplace, U.S. manufacturers must adapt to new technological developments and economic changes. Other nations have committed billions of dollars to support new automotive, clean energy and other manufacturing technologies because they know they represent the jobs of the future. Our country needs to do the same or we'll get left behind.I authored the Advanced Vehicle Technology Act of 2009 (HR 3246), which provides the Department of Energy with $2.85 billion over five years to partner with automakers, parts suppliers, universities, and industry consortiums to conduct innovative research and development projects. This funding will help ensure that the next generation of vehicles and vehicle technologies will be built right here in the United States. This legislation will create jobs in Oakland County and reduce America's dependence on foreign oil. H.R. 3246 passed the House on September 16, 2009 by a large bipartisan vote of 312-114, and was endorsed by the Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers, General Motors, Ford Motor Company, Chrysler, the UAW, the Motor and Equipment Manufacturers Association, Magna International, Delphi, ArvinMeritor, Robert Bosch LLC, Caterpillar, Dueco Odyne, Achates Power, the Engine Manufacturers Association, the League of Conservation Voters, the Sierra Club, and the Natural Resources Defense Council.The Manufacturing Extension Partnership is a critical national program that provides technical services and assistance to increase productivity and efficiency of small and medium-sized manufacturers. MEP support is vital to the long term success and competitiveness of small and medium sized American manufacturers, and preserving and strengthening the program should be a priority as Congress continues its efforts to revive the economy. Currently the costs of the MEP's services are shared between the federal government, state government, and industry with the federal government contributing one third, and states and industry contributing the remaining two thirds. However, state budget problems have destabilized the MEP funding structure. At least 23 state MEP centers reported a decrease or elimination of state MEP funding in 2009 alone, and some centers have been operating without state funding for years. When a state eliminates MEP funding, it is left to the manufacturers to cover the gap or risk losing critical federal dollars. I introduced legislation with Republican Rep. Vern Ehlers this year that would reduce the matching requirements for small manufacturers and strengthen the MEP program. H.R. 4393 would reduce the financial burden on small business during a recession and align the MEP's structure with other public-private programs operated by the government by reducing the match requirement. I look forward to continuing working with my colleagues in a bipartisan fashion to champion policies and programs that support American manufacturing.There is a great potential to revitalize our domestic manufacturing base by strengthening the domestic solar industry. While states like Michigan and many others certainly have the existing infrastructure and workforce to manufacture more solar technologies, the United States continues to lag behind China, Japan, and Europe in the manufacturing of photovoltaic modules. On October 22, 2009 the House passed H.R. 3585, the Solar Technology Roadmap Act. This important bill will strengthen our nation's solar energy industry and help us meet our domestic goals for renewable energy production. The bill will establish a roadmap and demonstration program to further advance solar technologies. The final version passed by the House included an amendment I authored to require the Department of Energy to give preference to projects in high unemployment states like Michigan. My amendment also required that all research, development and manufacturing resources be allocated in the United States. I believe that federal dollars should work to create American jobs, and this amendment seeks to ensure that these new investments are working to restore jobs lost in recent years.Return to TopSupporting our Domestic Automobile IndustryThe global race to create the ultra-efficient cars and other new manufacturing technologies of the 21st Century has begun, and the United States is already giving other nations a tremendous head start. If we want to maintain our economic competitiveness, create jobs and truly become energy independent, we must support our manufacturing sector and auto industry at the same pace as other countries.I have made fighting for our American automakers one of my top priorities. When Chrysler and GM were facing extinction, I strongly supported providing bridge loans to allow the companies to rebound from the global credit crisis. I stood up to Chrysler's debt holders, four major banks and a few dozen hedge funds who were trying to squeeze Chrysler for more than the fair market value of their debt. I argued they should make a good business decision and accept market price rather than the force the company into liquidation, and ultimately they did. When two of our Oakland County General Motors plants were facing permanent shutdown, I founded the Make it in Michigan campaign which earned the support of 30,000 citizens in asking GM to make their new subcompact car in Michigan. GM ultimately did decide to make their new car in Michigan, keeping two plants open and saving 1,400 jobs.Now we must support our domestic auto industry in the global competition to build the fuel efficient cars of the future. I authored the Advanced Vehicle Technology Act of 2009 (HR 3246), which provides the Department of Energy with $2.85 billion over five years to partner with automakers, parts suppliers, universities, and industry consortiums to conduct innovative research and development projects. This funding will help ensure that the next generation of vehicles and vehicle technologies will be built right here in the United States. This legislation will create jobs in Oakland County and reduce America's dependence on foreign oil. H.R. 3246 passed the House on September 16, 2009 by a large bipartisan vote of 312-114, and was endorsed by the Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers, General Motors, Ford Motor Company, Chrysler, the UAW, the Motor and Equipment Manufacturers Association, Magna International, Delphi, ArvinMeritor, Robert Bosch LLC, Caterpillar, Dueco Odyne, Achates Power, the Engine Manufacturers Association, the League of Conservation Voters, the Sierra Club, and the Natural Resources Defense Council.I am also a proud supporter of the Car Allowance Rebate System (CARS) Act, also known as the Cash for Clunkers program. CARS was initially approved by the Congress as part of the Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2009, and provided $1 billion in funding. When the program proved so popular that this funding was due to be completely exhausted within a matter of weeks, Congress passed emergency legislation providing an additional $2 billion in funding. There were over 690,000 transactions completed in the program, which provided an important boost for our automakers and helped result in positive GDP growth and economic expansion at a time when it was desperately needed. It also helped create a more fuel efficient vehicle fleet, resulting in a 9.2 MPG increase in average fuel economy.Return to TopEconomic Recovery ActThe American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (H.R. 1, also known as the stimulus bill) was enacted on February 17, 2009. The Act consisted of three parts: roughly one-third was tax cuts for families and businesses (one of the largest tax cuts in U.S. history), another one-third was emergency support including help for unemployed workers and funding to preserve education and public safety jobs, and the final one-third consisted of direct job-creating investments in things like infrastructure improvements and new technology development (efforts to prop up Wall Street banks were not part of the Recovery Act; the bill to approve that program--known as TARP--was enacted in the fall of 2008).The Recovery Act has already meant 69,000 additional jobs for Michigan in 2009 and a payroll tax cut for over four million Michigan residents. More jobs will be created as much of the job-creating investments will be dispersed in 2010. The Recovery Act has meant about 2 million more jobs across the U.S., according to both liberal and conservative economists. America lost nearly 750,000 jobs per month at the height of the crisis in early 2009, and the economy contracted 6% at the start of last year. Since the Recovery Act was passed in February of 2009, job losses steadily decreased until the U.S. saw net positive job creation in November and over 5% growth in the economy in the fourth quarter of '09. The Recovery Act has helped to get the economy moving in the right direction--but we must keep working.The problem is, while the Recovery Act has meant 2 million more jobs than we'd have otherwise and is on track to meet its goal of creating or saving 3.5 million jobs, the recession that began in late 2007 has lead to the U.S. losing 8 million jobs. Clearly, there is much more work to be done before our economy is fully recovered. I do not believe that government alone can get our economy back on track, but what it can do is help create the conditions necessary to get businesses to invest and create even more jobs. The Recovery Act's middle class tax cuts, homebuyer tax credit, car buyer tax credit and assistance for the unemployed helped jumpstart consumer spending. The business tax cuts, additional funding to repair Michigan roads and investments in new technologies (such as new advanced battery development in Michigan) are creating jobs and helping to create the environment necessary for businesses to hire again. Economists from the left and right agree that the Recovery Act kept us from falling into the 2nd Great Depression during the greatest economic crisis in generations, and is continuing to create the conditions for private business to grow.You can track the progress of the economic recovery act by clicking hereWhat has the Economic Recovery Act meant for Oakland County?Return to TopProtecting Home ValuesSince the collapse of the housing market in 2006, home values have been falling, and it is estimated that homeowners have lost as much as $5.9 trillion in home value since that time. Because concentrated foreclosures can bring down home prices in an entire neighborhood, the first step in stabilizing home values has to be ending the tide of foreclosures and making it easier for families who have seen the value of their homes sharply decline refinance their mortgage. Getting our housing markets back on track not only will help millions of families save their homes, it will also help lead to greater economic expansion and quicker recovery due to the huge economic impact of new housing construction.The main tool to help families facing foreclosure is the Making Home Affordable (MHA) Program, which was announced by President Obama on February 18, 2009. The MHA Program has two parts -- one which allows homeowners with mortgages owned or guaranteed by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac to refinance into a new, more affordable mortgage as long as they don't owe more than 125% of the current value of their home. The second part of this program seeks to encourage mortgage servicers to provide modifications that will result in lower monthly payments for troubled borrowers. Borrowers who obtained their mortgage for a single family home that is their primary residence before January 1, 2009 are eligible for monthly mortgage payments lowered to no more than 31% of their monthly income. To find out if you qualify for either program or to learn more, visit http://makinghomeaffordable.gov/ or call 888-995-HOPE.In 2008 Congress created the Hope for Homeowners Program, in 2009 Congress passed and the President signed into law the Helping Families Save Their Homes Act of 2009 which makes a number of improvements to that program. Under Hope for Homeowners, the mortgage lender agrees to write the mortgage down to a percentage of the home's currently appraised value, and the borrower receives a new 40 year fixed rate mortgage loan insured by the FHA. For more information about this program visit http://www.hud.gov/hopeforhomeowners/consumerfactsheet.cfm, or contact your lender, or a HUD approved non-profit housing counselor.

Currency manipulation on the part of China and other nations drives the cost of their imports down while pushing the cost of our exports up. Poorly written trade deals and a lack of enforcement on existing trade rules have pushed our trade deficit higher and higher. Japan and South Korea continue to employ unfair trade barriers to continue to block our automakers from selling cars there. Congress must unite across party lines and work with the administration to support fair trade for American businesses and workers.Those who favor the uninhibited free trade policies of the previous administration attempt to label anyone who does not agree with them as ""protectionist."" The notion that we must either support unadulterated free trade or put up walls and trade with no one is a false choice. The issue is not whether we should have more or less trade, it is about creating reasonable rules and enacting agreements that ensure that trade is fair for American workers and businesses so that trade creates jobs at home, rather than ship them overseas.For example, I supported a U.S. ""Cash for Clunkers"" program in which only American built cars could participate, but we were told that would violate international trade rules. However, the Japanese then crafted a Clunkers program in which American cars were effectively barred from participating. I spoke out against this injustice, and Japan promised they would allow American cars to participate. However, Japan later went back on this promise, allowing just a few U.S. models to participate. This is a clear example of unfair trade and I am continuing to fight it.I believe all international trade agreements must contain internationally recognized, enforceable labor and environmental standards. Agreements should also ensure that markets in strategic industries are opened for both nations, unlike, for example, the free trade agreement President Bush negotiated with South Korea. There is already a tremendous imbalance in the flow of automobiles between South Korea and the United States--in recent years, South Korea has sold over 700,000 vehicles here, while America has been permitted to sell only around 4,500. The Korea Free Trade Agreement would make this imbalance permanent. I will never support this deal as it is currently written.However, if a trade agreement contains key protections for workers and the environment, fairly opens markets for U.S. business and will create good paying jobs in critical industries, that agreement should be considered.When trade is fair, competition is fair, and when competing on a level playing field, American workers and business owners will win.",Issue Position: Economy

During my time representing Oakland County, I voted to expand the income tax exemption, to create a college tuition tax credit. To help older Americans and their families, I also personally sponsored an amendment to create a $500 tax credit for senior citizens.I also worked to cut taxes for small businesses to help them good paying jobs here in Michigan. I voted to exempt small businesses from having to pay taxes on wages for new employees, and to allow businesses to deduct unemployment expenses, FCTA taxes, and workers compensation costs.In Congress, I will start working immediately to pass tax credits for college tuition, child-care, and senior citizens. I will also promote efforts to reduce the cost of fuel, invest in our economy, and ensure that all Americans have access to quality, affordable health care.Families and small businesses here in Oakland County are being squeezed, and we can't afford to wait any longer to take action.Investing in EducationPersonally and in public service, education has always been a passion of mine. I learned the importance of an education early in my life. My father was public school teacher for over 25 years and he instilled in me a love of learning. He also taught me the necessity of passing on what we have learned to the next generation.Today, as we face new challenges and a rapidly changing economy, a quality education is more important than ever.I believe we must make a national commitment to pre-K-12 education. We must fully fund early childhood education programs, equip our classrooms with cutting edge technology, strengthen science and technology curricula, demand higher standards, reduce class size and make sure that we have the best trained, most qualified teachers in the world. And, we must also never neglect the unique needs of children in our special education programs.In Congress, I will also take action to address the rising cost of college. Recent legislation to lower student loan interest rates was an important step forward, but we need to do more. I will work to pass a college tuition tax credit, increase low-income student grants, and expand tuition assistance programs for students who go into critical public service fields including teaching, nursing and public safety.As a State Senator, I served as the ranking member of the Senate Education Committee, and I continually fought for policies that would expand educational opportunities for all children regardless of where they lived. I was particularly troubled by the fact that many schools in my Senate district lacked internet access.In order to rectify this problem I formed a grassroots organization called NetDay Michigan and we mobilized hundreds of volunteers to roll up their sleeves, pull wire and install donated computers. We wired twenty-two schools, libraries and recreation centers, and in the process, opened a world of opportunities for children who would not otherwise have access to computers and the internet.

For more than a year, Gary has been traveling across Michigan on a listening tour to hear directly from Michigan middle class families, small business owners, seniors, and veterans.Gary made listening to Michiganders the focus of his campaign, and he has been traveling all over the state to hear directly from Michigan families about the issues they talk about around their kitchen tables. The stories he hears from Michiganders are what guide his fight to make sure that anyone who works hard and plays by the rules can earn a fair shot to find a good job to support their family and retire with dignity. As Michigan's next U.S. Senator, Gary will continue to be the independent voice Michigan middle class families can trust.Gary's ads contrast strongly from Republican Terri Lynn Land's almost exclusively false, negative ads that have been debunked by fact checkers and media outlets. Despite Land outspending Gary 2:1 on TV with her false attacks and teaming up with out of state special interests, like the Koch Brothers, to spend over $18 million to buy this Senate seat, Gary has led in all recent polls.A script for the ad follows:GARY: Over the years, I have met many heroic women. I will never forget the one woman I met on a city bus one cold morning. She had just worked all night long, and was going to spend three hours on a bus going to and from work, and another three hours getting her daughters to and from school. She had little time to sleep, and no time to herself. She told me she dreamed only of giving her daughters a better life. I have also met many moms struggling to take care of their aging parents while raising their own children, and I even met a courageous woman who saved her family's small trucking company from bankruptcy. Those stories are with me and everything that I do. Our middle class is heroic. We sacrifice so that our children's lives can be a little better than our own.

0,Gary Peters,"Gary today recognized the fifth anniversary from the last time the minimum wage was raised -- from $6.55 to $7.25. Peters for Michigan released a video featuring Michiganders sharing why it is so important to Michigan's middle class to raise the minimum wage. Gary is a strong supporter for raising the minimum wage because he believes that people who work hard and play by the rules should have a fair shot to support their families and retire with dignity. Right now, too many families are falling behind because the minimum wage has not kept pace with cost of living or inflation. Gary helped introduce legislation in Washington, ""The Fair Minimum Wage Act"", that would incrementally raise the minimum wage to $8.20, $9.15 after a year, and $10.10 after two years.Gary said, ""My dad was a World War II veteran and public school teacher and my mother was a nurse's aide. Growing up in a middle class household taught me early on the importance of the values we all share. We work hard and play by the rules so that the next generation can be better off than the one before it. Raising the minimum wage to support a strong middle class and keep the promise of opportunity to those aspiring to get to the middle class is a core Michigan value.""","On Minimum Wage Anniversary, Gary Pushes for $10.10 Minimum Wage"

At stops in Detroit, Bay City, Traverse City, Muskegon and Lansing, Gary and Senator Stabenow visited with small businesses and families, showcasing the importance of protecting Michigan's Great Lakes as a vital part of Michigan's economy. Gary kicked off the tour Tuesday with stops in Battle Creek and Ann Arbor. Gary said: ""It was great to hear from Michigan small businesses and middle class families and see firsthand just how important the Great Lakes are to our state. Michigan's Great Lakes support thousands of good-paying jobs and play an essential role in our economy. As Michigan's next Senator, I will keep fighting so that we can protect the Great Lakes and ensure economic security for future generations."" Senator Stabenow said: ""Gary fights every day to protect our Great Lakes, which are critical to Michigan's economy, support thousands of jobs, and are part of our Michigan way of life. Gary stood up for Michigan families when he took on the Koch Brothers, who were polluting Detroit with their petroleum coke waste, and he won. I need Gary Peters as my partner in the U.S. Senate, because he is willing to stand up for the values and priorities that are right for Michigan."" Gary has always been an outspoken champion for Michigan's Great Lakes. Ever since Gary led the fight to ban drilling in the Great Lakes as a State Senator in 2002, he has worked with both Republicans and Democrats to protect the Great Lakes and help grow the economy. Most recently, Gary helped take on the Koch Brothers who were illegally piling their petroleum byproduct along the Detroit River, contaminating homes, businesses and the Great Lakes watershed. In the U.S. Senate, Gary will continue to fight to protect the Great Lakes from pollution and invasive species like Asian carp. Senator Stabenow, vice chair of the Great Lakes Task Force, has made protecting our Great Lakes for future generations a top priority. She authored the federal ban on oil and gas drilling in the Great Lakes and wrote the bipartisan Stop Invasive Species Act to expedite an action plan to stop the spread of invasive species like Asian carp. As Chairwoman of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry, Stabenow's 2014 Farm Bill created an historic new regional conservation partnership program- one of our country's most significant investments in land, water, and wildlife conservation. Senator Stabenow also authored the Michigan Lighthouse and Maritime Heritage Act to help restore lighthouses in Michigan and promote the maritime heritage of the Great Lakes.","Gary Peters, Senator Debbie Stabenow Highlight Need to Protect Michigan's Great Lakes on ""Great Lakes Jobs Tour"""
0,Gary Peters,"U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren today rallied support for Gary, praising him as an outstanding advocate for women and middle class families in Michigan and across the country. At a campaign event for Gary, Senators Warren and Stabenow along with Congressional Candidate Debbie Dingell outlined why he is the only candidate Michigan women and middle class families can count on to fight for them in the U.S. Senate. They also criticized his opponent's anti-middle class agenda -- from opposing equal pay and outlawing abortion without exception to putting up barriers between women and their doctors -- to illustrate why she cannot be trusted. Senator Warren said, ""The U.S. Senate needs more fighters like Gary Peters who are willing to stand up for women. It already has enough backward-looking extremists trying to block equal pay efforts while they support dangerous Supreme Court decisions like Hobby Lobby. I've also seen up close how Gary Peters has fought to level the playing field for middle class families through his work on the House Financial Services Committee to protect the new consumer agency and how hard he works to hold Wall Street banks accountable, so I know he will be the kind of fighter that we need in Washington."" Senator Stabenow said, ""Gary is a fighter, and he won't back down. I need a partner in the Senate who will stand by my side and fight for Michigan women and their families. Whether it's making sure that women can make their own health care decisions or finally guaranteeing equal pay for equal work, I know that Gary shares the priorities and the values that are right for Michigan."" Gary is a proven fighter for equal pay and women's health care. One of the first votes he took in Washington was to help pass the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. He helped introduce new efforts to close the gender pay gap and will fight to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act in the U.S. Senate. In addition, Gary has voted against every partisan attempt to defund Planned Parenthood and cut access to mammograms and cancer screenings. Unlike his opponent, Gary slammed the Hobby Lobby ruling. He believes that employers should not make private health care decisions for their employees. Gary said, ""It's an honor to have the support of Senator Warren and Michigan leaders like Senator Stabenow and Debbie Dingell for the grassroots campaign we are building together. When it comes to the future for Michigan and our middle class, the contrast in this race could not be more clear nor the stakes higher. I will continue to fight for the values we share as Michiganders, helping to rebuild our economy and a strong middle class, ensuring that women are not discriminated against in the workplace, that they have access to the health care they need, and at the end of the day folks can retire with dignity. My opponent supports an agenda that would turn back the clock on my daughters and yours and we cannot afford to have her backward vision for our state and our middle class."" Dingell said, ""Among the issues that concern me most is the shrinking middle class, and the fact that too many people are working harder and making less money with increasing costs in all aspects of their lives. Those are issues Gary and I will continue fighting for, him in the Senate and me in the House.""",Sen. Elizabeth Warren Praises Gary as a Champion for Michigan Women and Middle Class Families

0,Rick Snyder,"As Governor, I will revive the state's economic development efforts and make the Michigan Economic Development Corporation transparent and accountable as I work to create an envionment in which businesses and entrepreneurs can flourish. -Rick.he Michigan Economic Development Corporation (MEDC) was once a tool that supported a business-friendly climate and assisted entrepreneurs -- it needs to be again. Under Rick Snyder's leadership, the MEDC was once a successful economic development program that leveraged a business-friendly climate, a strong pool of talent, and the state's assets to accelerate the growth of a diverse business base. It can be again, and it should facilitate a strong network of regional partners working to connect talent with businesses. The MEDC should be focused on 5 key areas: 1) Business Retention and Attraction, 2) Business Acceleration and Startup Support, 3) Talent Enhancement, 4) Enhanced Financial Infrastructure to Support Entrepreneurs and 5) Benchmarking for Continuous Improvement.The MEDC has been mismanaged by the current administration. When Rick Snyder was appointed by Gov. Engler to be the first chair of the MEDC, Michigan was ranked No. 1 in the nation for five years for new business expansions by Site Selection Magazine. Now the state has dropped to the bottom in business-friendly rankings and is just ahead of Mississippi for new business expansions according to Site Selection.Lansing's career politicians have wasted tax dollars on expensive ad campaigns and false incentives while promising job creation -- without fixing Michigan's tax and regulatory system. With a million jobs disappearing this decade, Michigan's economic troubles can't be solved through television ads or taxpayer-funded credits. Lansing politicians need to get out of the business of picking winners and losers through incentives. Instead, they should create an environment where the tax burden is low, the regulatory environment is reasonable, and businesses have access to the support and resources that will help them create jobs in Michigan.The use of incentives should include performance objectives, reportable results, and be transparent to citizens. The state currently gives out $6.3 billion more in tax credits, deductions and incentives than it takes in yearly in tax revenue -- more than $30 billion a year in handouts that are supposed to be stimulating our economy. There is little transparency or accountability in what return the state is getting on those investments. Economic development incentives should be used sparingly and measured against the actual number of targeted jobs created to make the data more reliable and less subjective. The results should be posted online for everyone to see.Rick Snyder is the leader who can make the MEDC effective. Rick has led the MEDC and Michigan toward a healthy business climate before; he can do it again. He's done it at the local level with Ann Arbor SPARK. Because he's not a career politician, he has no special interests to pay back. He has one goal: creating jobs and reinventing the state of Michigan.",Issue Position: MEDC Reform
0,Rick Snyder,"Reinventing Michigan is going to require a change in culture and mindset. As Michiganders, we have to begin to take pride in small victories as we take steps to forward our state. We need to work across regional and political lines and avoid the win/lose mentality that brings our entire state down. -Rick.Michigan's reputation has fallen along with its economic decline. It will not be easy, but Michigan has the potential to be the comeback story of this era. Our history is one of innovation, resilience and a shared work ethic that has been the envy of the world. This is the state that built America's middle class and inspired the American Dream. We rose to the top before and we can do it again.Michigan has been on the receiving end of bad news and publicity for too long. For the last several years, Michigan has been on the receiving end of bad news and negative publicity. The state's current economic crisis cannot be ignored and much of the bad news is based on fact. However, the constant negative drumbeat can eventually take its toll on citizens, causing many to believe that the state is in permanent decline with little or no hope of revival.Empty promises and divisiveness won't solve our state's problems. This isn't the time for empty promises. ""Happy talk"" won't solve our state's problems. Only action will -- which is why we need a little less talk and a lot more action. We need to take steps forward in a positive direction and it's obvious that career politicians aren't up to the task. We must also recognize the lingering effects of old divides. We cannot afford the various forms of internal competition and the win/lose mentality that has been with us for too long. Our collective actions should be predicated on the understanding that we all populate this great state together and our future largely depends on the success of all our citizens and communities.Michigan needs to take action -- and turn great challenges into great opportunities. When it comes to economic development, adopting the reforms Rick has proposed, notably those focused on reforming the MEDC combined with regulatory reform and the elimination of the MBT, will allow our existing businesses to grow. As job growth occurs and new businesses relocate to Michigan, all of us will experience a renewed sense of pride. Detroit offers a great opportunity. With new city leadership in place and with appropriate help from state government, the process of central city renewal can begin -- this time in a sustainable way. By adopting youth-friendly policies and programs we can begin to keep them here.Michigan needs victories, both large and small, and Rick is the leader to get the job done. We need victories, both large and small. Along the way a culture is changed. People come to believe that continuing economic improvement is not only possible, it's actually taking place. More people decide to stay in Michigan to give this great state another chance. Rick's vision is for a government that listens to the people, asks them to help set priorities, operates in a fully transparent manner and measures actual results against agreed-upon objectives. That will help citizens develop a sense of confidence and responsibility for their state. With confidence comes a winning attitude. It does not result from one spectacular success.

0,Rick Snyder,"The goal of protecting Michigan's environment is to ensure that future generations can enjoy the same awe inspiring natural resources that we're enjoying today and to support our economic recovery. This is not a partisan or political effort-it's about the preservation of the fabric that makes our state great. It's about protecting and enriching Michigan's soul. -RickMichigan needs to be a national leader and innovator in protecting the environment. Michigan is blessed with natural resources that serve as the foundation for the quality of life of our citizens, contribute to the economic vitality of our state, and offer a competitive advantage as we transition into a new era. The state must make smart investments and develop long range plans focused on safeguarding its citizens, protecting the environment, and ensuring that Michigan's natural treasures are preserved for future generations. Michigan must also support industries like agriculture, tourism, outdoor recreational activities, and renewable energy.Career politicians are jeopardizing our resources and compromising our reputation as a leader in environmental stewardship. In recent years, a lack of leadership has allowed Michigan to become more reactive than proactive in protecting the environment and positioning the state for future success. The ongoing state budget crisis has destabilized funding for critical conservation and preservation efforts and is threatening federal funding. Unless Michigan makes environmental protection a priority again, federal matching funds could be jeopardized and the state could lose the authority to administer environmental programs to the federal government.Public and private partnerships provide a sustainable funding model to stem the tide. State government needs to build partnerships with local governments, private businesses, non-profits, and citizens to preserve and protect our environment. Michigan's research universities and talented professionals need to be leveraged as part of a comprehensive plan to safeguard our communities when unforeseen environmental hazards occur. Public and private partnerships should not only help with funding but also monitor the environment, identify potential threats before they occur, and swiftly deal with incidents that do occur.The state needs a systematic approach for managing and safeguarding natural resources against environmental threats. Limited financial resources require Michigan to have consistent and reliable conservation strategies to efficiently and effectively deal with environmental threats. The four step process that should serve as the framework for protecting Michigan for future generations includes 1) Prevention, 2) Early Detection, 3) Rapid Response Mechanism, and 4) Management.Rick Snyder is the right leader to help protect the environment while growing the economy. As a member of the board of trustees of the Michigan Chapter of the Nature Conservancy, Rick has gained great insight into the issues facing Michigan and the role that the state should play in the Great Lakes Region.

0,Rick Snyder,"It's time for the citizens to take back control of Michigan's broken budget process and Lansing to show us real value for money. As Governor, I will fix our broken budget system and bring fiscal responsibility, stability, transparency, and the citizens' priorities to state government. -Rick.What Value For Money Budgeting is: The citizens of Michigan ought to have the first say in how their tax dollars are spent, and the state must ensure its citizens actually get what they pay for. Value For Money budgeting accomplishes this. It's an innovative approach to budgeting that begins by asking citizens how their tax dollars should be spent and setting tangible ways to measure the success of every state program.How Value For Money budgeting differs from Michigan's current broken system: In Michigan today the budget system is a tool of special interests and lobbyists who don't care -- or even ask -- what Michiganders want. They use money and political favors to influence Lansing into spending state dollars on their priorities. The result is a spending plan with no connection to the needs of our state. Poor fiscal management and a lack of oversight mean the people of Michigan never even know whether they receive the services their tax dollars supposedly pay for.Why Value For Money budgeting works: Value For Money works because it takes the budget-writing process out of Capitol building backrooms and puts it into our communities. It's a system that: 1) puts citizens first in determining budget priorities, 2) determines what a successful budget would look like, 3) selects effective strategies for achieving citizens' budget goals, 4) examines state government to ensure services are being delivered in the most efficient -- and cost-effective -- way, 5) takes a multi-year view rather than a short-sighted one, 6) sets real measures for whether money is paying for what was intended, and 7) regularly reports back to the citizens so they can hold government accountable.Where Value For Money has been proven to work: Washington State reduced a $2.4 billion deficit without raising taxes by asking citizens to tell government leaders what goals they should focus on Iowa's Department of Transportation saved $35 million annually by engaging citizens and ordering a comprehensive review of all services and management Charlotte, NC's population doubled in the 1990s, but 26 departments were consolidated into 9 and the municipal workforce was reduced by 8%, while surveys indicated greater than 80% approval of nearly all services.Why Rick is the right candidate to put Value For Money budgeting in place: Yes, Value For Money is a simple concept. So why hasn't it been put in place in Michigan before? Because a lack of leadership in Lansing. Politicians placed the desires of special interests before the needs of our state. Rick Snyder is the only candidate who has the leadership necessary to take this innovative and important idea and put it into practice.",Issue Position: Value for Money Budgeting
0,Rick Snyder,"As Governor, I will reform Michigan's regulatory envrionment so that it facilitates economic growth while protecting our citizens and environment. Regulations need to be based on sound science and economics and shouldn't be burdensome on job providers. Rather than focusing on enforcement, we need a fair and efficient system that focuses on helping citizens comply -Rick.Michigan needs to reform the regulatory system so that it grows the economy while it protects citizens and the environment. Michigan's regulatory system should make it easy for businesses to comply and should focus on helping job providers create and grow their businesses, while protecting citizens and the environment at the same time.The current regulatory environment makes it frustrating, time-consuming, and costly to do business in Michigan. Every state has to manage a regulatory environment with federal and local regulations, but Michigan's process is failing businesses and bureaucrats are overly enforcing regulations to raise new revenue. The excessive focus on enforcement and frivolous administrative delays make it nearly unbearable to do business. Iowa and Indiana have both streamlined approval processes, with a great deal of success.Regulations need to take into account the economic impact and be based on sound science. Michigan should follow Virginia, one of the most business-friendly states, and require an Economic Impact Analysis (EIA) that summarizes the costs and benefits of the proposed regulation, outlines potential unintended consequences, and identifies any less costly or less intrusive alternatives.Businesses should be treated like customers -- compliance should be made simple and easy. The majority of Michiganders want more jobs and a clean environment and government should treat them accordingly. Businesses should have access to standard applications, ""compliance toolkits,"" compliance assistance representatives, an automatic approval timeline and a permit tracking system. Departments and agencies should benchmark and report the results to citizens.Rick Snyder has the right experience to deliver real reform with the regulatory environment.

Midnight deals, closed doors meetings, lobbyists, and special interest influence have stood in the way of long-term solutions. As Governor, I will ensure that government is open, fair, and accountable to the citizens by making Michigan a national leader in transparency and ethics.Michigan needs to make a commitment to open, honest, and ethical government to get things moving in Lansing. Citizens have the right to expect more from elected officials, especially when the state needs critical, thoughtful solutions to help Michigan recover. Making government more accessible and responsive to citizens and reducing the influence of special interests and lobbyists will increase efficiency and reduce barriers that impede progress in Lansing. There is a very strong linkage between disclosure requirements, improved performance, and improved ethical behavior, all of which lead to an increased level of accountability.Lobbyists and special interests have had an adverse effect on Lansing. The role of lobbyists has changed in Lansing since term limits were adopted. The state legislature became more reliant on lobbyists and special interests to provide subject-matter expertise on a wide array of issues and foster a network of connections. This created an environment where powerful, well-funded interest groups have more influence than citizens. Banning gifts, creating a cooling-off period and requiring full disclosure of Michigan's lobbyist activities will reduce impediments to progress and keep the best interest of the public in mind. Reforming campaign finances will empower citizens. As it currently exists, Michigan law allows unregulated third party contributions to finance ads and robo-calls, masquerading them as issue advertising without revealing the funding source. This leaves the door open for well financed interest groups to influence the outcome of the election by providing voters with misleading accusations without fear of reprisal. Rick Snyder is the man to reinstate full-scale ethical behavior in Lansing. Rick is the only candidate that has not developed his professional acumen in Michigan's dysfunctional governmental culture. He has spent his entire career improving organizations by creating, achieving, and reporting performance measurements to stockholders, customers and business partners. He is an ideal person to lead the state's ethical reform.",Issue Position: Ethics Reform
0,Rick Snyder,"Michigan citizens should have access to the highest quality care available. As Governor, I will manage rising costs by implementing innovative management strategies, expanding access through community based solutions, and promoting wellness programs that identify problems before they become chronic or more serious. -Rick.Promoting Patient-Centered Medical Homes will improve Michigan's overall health. Michigan needs an improved healthcare delivery model that is affordable, accessible, and efficient. Each citizen should have a Patient-Centered Medical Home, which will improve the quality of healthcare and reduce costs by identifying health problems and focusing on wellness prevention early, before issues become severe or chronic.Poor lifestyle choices and an outdated approach to healthcare have caused Michigan to be one of the unhealthiest states in the nation. Roughly half of the causes of death in Michigan are related to preventable risk factors like cigarette smoking, overeating, and lack of exercise. While the highest value is placed on making sure that the younger members of the population are healthy and cared for (see chart at right), the larger adult population has not taken on enough responsibility for its own personal decisions. For years, discussions across Michigan have looked at healthcare as a way to treat disease. Now, people are beginning to understand that this is only half the equation.Public-Private Partnerships will increase access to health care for those in dire need. The state should support public-private partnerships, local community pilot projects, and federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) that help reduce costs and increase access for vulnerable citizens. These programs provide a viable alternative for the uninsured and under-insured who would normally go directly to the emergency room for costly care.Rick Snyder is the best candidate to reform Michigan's healthcare system. A lack of leadership by career politicians is partly to blame for Michigan's unhealthiness. Rick, on the other hand, co-founded a successful Michigan company that combines innovative technology with traditional healthcare expertise to provide an interactive, web-based health-coach for individuals to develop a personal plan to live healthier.

0,Rick Snyder,"As Governor, I will get rid of the worst business tax in the country and replace it with a simple and fair solution that reduces the tax burden by 1.5 billion dollars-a flat corporate income tax. -Rick.Replacing the Michigan Business Tax with a flat corporate tax will reduce the state's tax burden, stimulate the economy, and create jobs. Businesses should not have to navigate a complicated and unfair tax code that was written by politicians. Instead, they should be able to simply take their federal corporate taxable income and multiply it by a low single-digit rate. Rick Snyder proposes that the Michigan Business Tax (MBT) be replaced with a flat corporate income tax -- a simple solution that will amount to a tax cut of likely more than $1 billion.Professional politicians created the current system. Politicians created the MBT based on last-minute revenue needs and to keep special interests satisfied. They included dozens of incentives, credits, and deductions -- so called ""tax expenditures"" that unfairly favor some businesses over others.The current tax system makes it difficult to do business in Michigan, costing our state jobs. The cost of doing business in Michigan is 2-4% higher to companies here than those in most other states. In today's economy, 2-4% could mean the difference between being in the black or the red. Plus, the MBT puts homegrown businesses at a disadvantage -- it caused Plymouth's Stardock Corporation's tax liability to increase from $1,200 to $170,000; Bronner's Christmas Wonderland in Frankenmuth experienced a 500% increase; Ansara Brothers Real Estate in Farmington Hills saw a 492% increase; and an accountant in Southfield, was faced with a 1,300% increase.The remedy is a flat corporate tax of 6%. A flat corporate income tax of 6%, with a reasonable exclusion for small businesses, will amount to a $1.5 billion tax reduction on Michigan businesses -- $1.5 billion more back in the hands of employers who will be able to invest in Michigan and hire unemployed workers. A Tax Foundation study shows that for every $1 reduction in corporate taxes, wages increase $2.50 over 5 years. Rick Snyder will put in place ""Value for Money"" budgeting and other reforms that decrease spending, while giving citizens the quality services they deserve.Rick Snyder is the leader who can reform Michigan's tax system. Replacing the MBT with a fair corporate income tax is a simple solution, but one that career politicians do not have the will not to implement.

As Governor, I will ensure that Michigan's children have the best possible preparation and education for life that enables them to compete and innovate in tomorrow's global knowledge-based economy. -Rick.Transforming Michigan's educational system is essential to prepare our children to compete globally in a knowledge-based economy. The long-term economic success of a region or state depends on its ability to educate, prepare, and train the next generation of workers. Michigan needs a smart, nimble, and innovative workforce that can adapt to the needs of the knowledge-based economy and compete with anyone in the world. Transforming our current educational system so that it thrives in today's economy will take a significant amount of time and effort, but Michigan can't afford to delay any further.Michigan has spent a lot on education in recent times without a good return on investment. The American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) ranked Michigan 42 nd nationwide in its most recent report card on American schools, down from 22 nd in 2002, despite student expenditures and teacher compensation that scored in the top 20%. Michigan's performance fell behind other states in the Great Lakes Region.Michigan needs to adopt a ""P-20"" model, reduce overhead costs, track real results, reward good performance, handle failing schools and leverage the private sector to improve the quality of education. Michigan should implement a data collection and support system similar to the one currently used in Florida. Parents should have a school finder website that allows them to evaluate how schools are performing when deciding where to send their kids. Michigan needs to tie school funding to specific goals and reforms and the private sector should contribute through philanthropic efforts. Michigan needs to adopt a system of merit-based pay that rewards better performing teachers and schools, and should quickly address failing schools.Rick Snyder is the leader who can reform Michigan's educational system. As a former educator and the father of three students, he understands the importance of improving Michigan's educational system. Rick Snyder knows how to transform the state's educational system to bring about an era of innovation.

0,Rick Snyder,"Revitalizing Michigan's Central Cities is essential to the economic recovery of our state. With vibrant cities that have both economic opportunity and offer a great quality of life, our state will be positioned as a world leader again. As Governor, I will provide the leadership and vision necessary to support the restoration of our cities and control urban sprawl. -Rick.Michigan economic future depends on having strong, vibrant cities. For Michigan to be a world leader again, the state's central cities need to be revitalized into vibrant places where families want to visit, work, and live. For Michigan to become a great state again, its central cities must become communities of opportunity with positive reputations. With vibrant cities and Michigan's existing world-class university system, the state will retain more of the best and brightest needed to compete in the global knowledge-based economy.Michigan's cities have become ground zero in the economic recession -- poor planning and a lack of leadership haven't helped. Michigan's cities have been ground zero for this recession and they must become ground zero for Michigan's recovery. All of Michigan's major cities have been rocked by high unemployment rates, foreclosures, and uncertain economic prospects that have made the last decade one of the most dismal times in the state's history. The dire situation has also damaged Michigan's reputation. Throughout the past decade gimmicks like ""Cool Cities"" have been offered as stop-gap solutions while there hasn't been a long-term vision or consistent focus on central cities from state leadership.Michigan needs to eliminate the regional win-lose mentality and rid its cities of waste and corruption. Regional leaders need to understand that the win-lose mentality and unhealthy competition for business and development with other regions damages the overall reputation of the state. They need to understand that the well-being of the entire state depends on the success of all of Michigan's central cities. Michigan needs to foster a culture of honest, ethical behavior in all levels of government that will not tolerate fraud, waste, and abuse.Michigan must properly plan growth, offer incentives to youth, combat poverty and crime, restore funding for the arts and invest in infrastructure and mass transit. Michigan needs to address urban sprawl with smart growth strategies would offer tax credits as an incentive for young professionals who choose to live and work in the city, like Maine has successfully done. The state also needs to work closely with local agencies and encourage community collaboration to make Michigan's cities safer, fight poverty and help those in need. Michigan needs to invest in the arts and cultural community -- which generate nearly $2 billion annually. Michigan must prioritize investment in the state's crumbling infrastructure and develop a long-range transportation plan that includes mass transit without increasing the burden on taxpayers.Rick Snyder is prepared to lead the effort to revitalize Michigan's central cities. Rick Snyder grew up in Battle Creek and lived in Detroit during tough economic times. His success in nurturing businesses and creating jobs in the knowledge-based economy as well as his community leadership demonstrates that he understands where the future of our cities lies.

""MAEAP has a great record of successfully encouraging farms to participate in environmentally sustainable practices.

""MAEAP has become a national model for addressing environmental challenges while providing opportunities for agriculture-based businesses to expand.""""Michigan farmers who earn MAEAP verification are leaders in environmental stewardship,"" said Department of Environmental Quality Director Dan Wyant. ""This program is about making sure farmers take extra steps to protect our land and water resources. We congratulate the farmers who have stepped up to take this challenge. We are proud of what MAEAP has accomplished in improving Michigan's environment, and we look forward to celebrating the next 2,500 agricultural leaders who choose to commit to environmental stewardship.""Michigan is the second most agriculturally diverse state in the nation. As a result, a one-size-fits-all approach to environmental protection simply does not work on Michigan farms. MAEAP effectively overcomes this challenge by offering areas of concentration known as systems.Each system focuses on a different aspect of a farming operation. Farmers can become verified in all systems applicable to their farm. The systems are:Farmstead -- The MAEAP Farmstead System addresses environmental risks at the farmstead, from safe fuel handling to the proper storage of fertilizers and pesticides. It focuses on protecting surface and groundwater. It is the one MAEAP system which is applicable to every size and kind of operation.Cropping -- The MAEAP Cropping System primarily focuses on environmental issues related to cropping activities, such as irrigation and water use, chemigation, soil conservation, nutrient and pest management, and well head protection. The system has components focused on environmental issues related to managing diverse commodities.Livestock -- The MAEAP Livestock System primarily focuses on environmental issues related to livestock activities, including manure handling, storage and field application, as well as conservation practices to protect water and prevent soil erosion. The Livestock System targets all Michigan livestock farms, regardless of species or operational size. The Livestock System concentrates on production and conservation practices, equipment, structures and management activities.MAEAP has an impressive record of success. Nearly 10,000 farms are at some stage within the verification process. Manure management and conservation plans are in place for more than 500,000 acres; field conservation practices assure almost 350,000 tons of soil stay on fields; phosphorus delivery to lakes and streams are reduced by 600,000 pounds each year; 730,000 acres receiving pesticides have approved pesticide management plans; 13,000 acres of filter strips have been installed; and 2,300 gullies have been stabilized improving water quality over the last three years.For more information on MAEAP, visit www.michigan.gov/maeap","Gov.

Snyder recommended it as a priority within his Fiscal Year 2015 budget recommendations. The amount is among the highest ever dedicated from a state to community colleges for skilled trades' job development.""Our economy is growing beyond the comeback phase, and the positive business environment and job growth are major reasons for the increasing demand for skilled trades' positions,"" Snyder said. ""Today's action is a step to ensure Michiganders have in-demand skills for the jobs of today and tomorrow. ""Skilled-trade jobs require education beyond high school, but not a four-year degree, and usually call for on-the-job training. The career range includes jobs in health care (lab technicians, dental hygienist), maintenance and repair, public safety, manufacturing (machine operators, welders), along with work as carpenters, plumbers and electricians.

Under the program, community colleges can apply for up to $4.8 million. Each award requires the community college to come up with a 25 percent match of the total equipment cost, including installation, renovations and instructor training. The proposal requires collaboration with school districts and a detailed plan on how the additional funding will help to meet employers' job needs.Michigan also allocates $10 million to support Community Ventures, which places structurally unemployed workers in temporary and full-time positions, and $10 million for the Skills Trades Training Fund, which provides grants to 25 Michigan Works! agencies which award Michigan companies that provide on-the-job training with funding.Michigan also provides $1 million to support the Michigan Advanced Technician Training program.

Senator Ayotte will campaign for Land in Michigan next week.U.S. Senator Kelly Ayotte, New HampshireWith the First Lady in Michigan today, we certainly admire Mrs. Obama as a great mom for raising her daughters under unimaginable pressure, and we believe, and I certainly believe, that Mrs. Obama would not condone the rhetoric that we've heard that is being used against Terri Lynn Land in terms of her role as a mom and how that would inform her decision making in the U.S. Senate. I'm a mom in the U.S. Senate, and you know frankly we don't have enough, we have 20 women in the U.S. Senate, we don't have enough people who have had the experience in the Senate who have children and are in a position where they can bring that perspective to the U.S. Senate. I think we need more moms in the Senate and people who would make the country better and safer for children and future generations of Americans. So when I ran, and I continue all the time to talk about the experience of being a mother and what that means to policy decisions in Washington. Moms bring an incredibly important perspective. In many households, moms are the primary or sole breadwinners. They are making so many of the important decisions on family finances, on health care, and to me to see stereotypes being pushed, or to see Terri being criticized for referencing her experience as a mom, and how that would inform her decisions as a policy maker, you know, I can't believe that we are even here, that we aren't beyond this. So the comments that are being made, it's just shocking that the Democratic Party in Michigan would actually say some of the things they've said in terms of coming after Terri's role as a mom and that's why I wanted to be part of this today because we need Terri in the U.S. Senate, we need her voice, and we need someone who is not going to just be like her opponent, a basically, a rubber stamp for the President but is going to put Michigan first. So next week I am looking forward to coming to Michigan to campaign for Terri as I am so impressed with her record as a state leader and I look forward to talking more about how Terri would be a great Senator and to visiting your beautiful state of Michigan.GOP Nominee for U.S. Senate Terri Lynn LandFirst of all I want to say thank you Senator Ayotte and national committeewoman Ronna Romney McDaniel and all the members of the press who've joined us today to discuss this important issue. You know I learned that Congressman Peters campaign and allies took to Twitter for being a mom and framing it around important policy matters through the lens as a parent, you know I was offended. I mean, Congressman Peters went too far. But I'm not shocked by this. I worked my entire life to public service and to helping our citizens here in Michigan. You know when I graduated from Hope College after starting my family with my husband, Dan, I was elected Kent County's first female County Clerk and Register of Deeds. And in addition to doing exactly what I said I'd do, which was modernize the office and cut costs and improve customer service, I also led the charge in our office for work-life balance for working parents. I opened up new tracks of management for working moms. And after 8 years, I term-limited myself and didn't run for reelection as county clerk, and by the time I left we had more women managers than when I started. So when I ran for Secretary of State, and won, I made sure that we instituted those same programs there that we had in Kent County, and I implemented them statewide. We came up with a Lead Worker Program that would help female managers learn the skills that they needed to be managers and give them that flexibility. And by the time I left there we had more women managers than when I started. You know, given the amount of attention and resources that the White House dedicates to the workplace flexibility, you know I thought for sure we'd be able to come together on this, Republicans and Democrats, implementing policies in the U.S. Senate. But I was wrong. You know, in the spring, President Obama himself criticized me for reforms to the workplace, the same types of reforms he called for this summer in his flexibility summit. Now Congressman Peters has tried to criticize my record for working for women. But I'm not going to be lectured by a man who pays the women on his staff 67 cents on the dollar compared with male staff. And I'm not going to be criticized by a man who allows his staff to disrespect the moms in Michigan. You know, I don't accept these empty attacks, and I challenge him to denounce the attacks on Michigan moms. Now, Congressman Peters and his allies are trying to make folks think that I don't have what it takes to be a U.S. Senator because I'm a mom. Well I think it's very important as Senator Ayotte mentioned and Ronna mentioned women bring that perspective to every job that they have. And it's very important that you have more moms in the U.S. Senate when they think about the issues that are affecting us today. I look forward to serving in the U.S. Senate and looking at all of those issues that are important. So you know my entire life I've been told I couldn't do it, but we made sure that we did and we're going to do that and win the U.S. Senate seat.Republican National Committeewoman Ronna Romney McDanielLike Senator Ayotte, I think we need more common sense moms who have a record of making government work, like Terri, in the United States Senate. Recent attacks from the Peters campaign and even the media are absurd and sexist. One Michigan columnist even called Terri a music video diva recovering from plastic surgery. This is not the first time a strong conservative woman has come under fire from the left. In 2012, my aunt, Ann Romney, was criticized by Democrat strategist Hillary Rosen for being a stay-at-home mom, choosing to raise 5 boys. Democrats and media alike were quick to condemn these attacks and distance themselves from Ms. Rosen's comments. I am calling on the Michigan press, Gary Peters and First Lady Michelle Obama to condemn the attacks on Terri for being a mom. It is troubling to see Gary Peters claim over and over that he is an outspoken supporter of women, only to have him remain silent as Terri is attacked. Does Gary Peters believe that moms have no business caring about foreign affairs, health care or earning a paycheck? Gary Peters claims to support equal pay yet he only pays his female staffers 67 cents on the dollar compared to men, according to his own math. The same math he used in the spring to push the White House's agenda. While Peters is talking about fighting for women, he only pays the women that work for him a fraction of what he pays the men who work for him. Gary Peters and his friends have criticized Terri for her accomplishments in local and state government, increasing flexibility for working moms. While Terri was Kent County Clerk and Michigan Secretary of State, she instituted programs to put more women on the management track and give employees more flexibility in their jobs. Flexibility is crucial for working moms, and it is absolutely stunning to me that Democrats, including President Obama, have attacked Terri over workplace flexibility. Wasn't it the White House that hosted a forum on workplace flexibility earlier this year? Their attacks are absolutely hollow, and Michigan voters will reject them. Finally, not just moms but all voters want someone who will actually show up. Considering the number of votes that Gary Peters has missed to campaign, moms know that Gary Peters puts himself, not Michigan, first. Moms have knack for seeing through people and their intentions. While Gary Peters runs a campaign based on dividing women, Terri plans to go to Washington and put every Michigander first.",Senator Kelly Ayotte and National Committeewoman Ronna Romney McDaniel Join Terri Lynn Land to Call on Michelle Obama and Gary Peters to Denounce Anti-Mom Rhetoric

As Michigan's Secretary of State, Terri was focused on making government work for the people and that's exactly the customer-focused approach we need to fix the problems at the Department of Veterans Affairs. Terri will honor the sacrifices made by veterans and their families and make veterans' issues and keeping our country safe top priorities in the U.S. Senate.""""I am honored to have the support of so many of Michigan's brave and selfless veterans, and I promise to work for them every single day as Michigan's U.S. Senator. Our military men and women represent the best of who we are, and it is our duty to honor them with the respect and dignity they deserve. I support policies that put Michigan veterans first, like reforming the VA by increasing quality of care and increasing accountability of the administration. I also support expanding job-training programs for veterans to get back into the workforce after active duty, creating incentives for companies that hire veterans, and I believe we must do more to ensure spouses of active duty military members are able to find good-paying jobs to support their families while serving our great nation."" -- Terri Lynn Land",Michigan Veterans Support Terri Lynn Land
0,Terri Lynn Land,"By Bill McMorrisTerri Lynn Land is hoping that her focus on kitchen table issues can convince heavily Democratic voters in Michigan to send a Republican to the U.S. Senate for the first time in 20 years.Democrats have won the last two Senate elections by 30 and 20 points, respectively. Land seemed to be riding a wave of support in 2013, emerging with steady leads late in the year, but after a poor performance at a June candidates' forum and a steady stream of attack ads financed by Sen. Harry Reid (D., Nev.), radical environmentalist billionaire Tom Steyer, and unions, Land now trails Peters by 6.5 points, according to Real Clear Politics.The key to overcoming that deficit, according to Land, is focusing on the actual concerns of Michigan voters, rather than those of Washington. Her opponent, Democratic Rep. Gary Peters, can campaign all he wants on environmentalism and the bogus ""war on women"": Land says she is singularly focused on jobs.It influences every aspect of her platform. She believes global warming is real, but says stringent EPA regulations will do more harm than good. Illegal immigration may be important to the Chamber of Commerce and La Raza, but Land is more concerned about its contribution to falling wages for low-skilled American workers. A secure border will help secure stable blue collar paychecks, while streamlining legal immigration for high skilled workers will boost America's economy.Land hasn't shied from breaking with national Republicans to demonstrate that her campaign's ""Put Michigan First"" refrain is more than just a slogan. In June, Land announced her opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a free trade agreement between the United States and more than a dozen Asian companies. She supports free trade, but not at the expense of Michigan manufacturing and the automobile industry, which suffer from large tariffs in Japan and South Korea, even as those countries expand their market in the United States.""I want fair and free trade and want to make sure that it makes sure it benefits Michigan producers. Whether its agriculture or manufacturing, you have to make sure it goes both ways,"" she said in an exclusive interview with the Washington Free Beacon.Limiting the harm of free trade agreements, however, will only stem the bleeding in Michigan's job market. Land recognizes that the blue collar jobs that once made Michigan one of the most prosperous states for the middle class in the country are not coming back. But attacking the ""1 percent"" and engaging in class warfare, as Peters is prone to do, will do nothing to help unemployed factory workers. Land prefers to offer these voters a solution, rather than a bogeyman. One of her top priorities in Washington will be beefing up high skilled jobs training and establishing a student loan program for muscle labor.""We really need high skill workers. That's what I'm hearing from the businesses I talk to. So instead of focusing on just four-year college, they could get the same [student] loans and support as a person who goes to college,"" Land says.The Republican said there is a key distinction between her program and the job training agenda put forth by President Obama. She wants the states, rather than the federal government, to steer the training program; federal bureaucrats have a hard time distinguishing the needs of Michigan and Mississippi businesses.""Flexibility is the most important piece of my program. Every state is different, so it's important that we allow states to make decisions about what type of training their workers need,"" she says. ""We need to make sure that we work with the locals and local business. The federal government does not have the answers. The local folks understand what they need for their job training and businesses.""She points to the fact that America still faces a deficit in its high-skilled workforce, despite--or because of--the existence of 47 training programs housed in myriad government agencies. A federal jobs program intended to put people back to work may just as easily turn into a program designed to help green energy at the expense of workers and the economy. Land wants to consolidate these programs at the federal level, while expanding options in states.Land knows a bit about revamping bureaucracy. She served two terms as Michigan secretary of state, which put her in charge of the most hated of all government agencies: the Department of Motor Vehicles. She streamlined the agency, adopted new technology to increase efficiency, all without laying off a single employee, she said. Wait times fell, office morale improved, and Land managed the impossible, increasing her popularity while serving as the public face of the DMV.Land may have been trusted to make the DMV run on time, but voters are less enthused about sending the Republican to represent them in Washington. Michigan has been more than willing to hand Republicans control of administrative and executive posts in the Lansing statehouse. Republican Gov. Rick Snyder leads Democratic opponent Gary Schauer by 3 points, even as Land trails.She is campaigning as a Capitol Hill problem solver, just as she was in the statehouse.""As secretary of state, I had a Democratic governor and a Democratic legislature, but we reformed the voting system and modernized the DMV because I recognized that you need to talk to everybody,"" she said. ""There are 400 bills that have passed the House on a lot of issues that have Democratic support, but Reid doesn't let them see light of day.""Voters can expect that to continue if Gary Peters is elected. He will serve as a rubber stamp for Harry Reid's agenda, according to Land, while she will bring an administrator's eye for effective governance to the post.""People want government to work for them and they want to be able to see their elected officials pass bills,"" she says. ""It takes a lot of work, but I showed that it can happen.""",The Washington Free Beacon - The Jobs First Agenda in Michigan

Peters sent a contract to a Chinese company when he was at the State Lottery, and he voted to send over a billion of our tax dollars overseas to companies that make cars in places such as China.

He used our taxes to hurt our auto industry. We make great cars in Detroit. Detroit put America on wheels. We need our money working here, creating jobs in Michigan -- not China.

0,Terri Lynn Land,"By Bill McMorrisMichigan Democrat Gary Peters is facing blowback from a new Democratic Senate Campaign Committee attack ad targeting the Koch brothers.National Democrats have purchased statewide airtime for an attack ad, titled ""Cloud,"" that seeks to tie Republican nominee Terri Lynn Land to the libertarian billionaire Koch brothers. The 30-second spot accuses the brothers of profiting off the release of ""pet coke,"" a petroleum byproduct environmentalists say is a pollutant, in Michigan.""Their giant piles of illegally stored pet coke threatened the health of Michigan residents and now they're out to contaminate our elections,"" a narrator says as a black cloud sweeps across the screen.However, the Koch brothers are not the only ones to profit from pet coke investments: Peters has invested nearly $20,000 in French oil giant Total S.A., which operates several pet coke operations in the United States.Those investments are at odds with Peters' rhetoric and his multi-million dollar support from environmentalists. Peters, who is worth approximately $2 million, said lucrative oil investments are ""a little bit of stock"" that will not interfere with his environmental policy.Neither the DSCC, nor the Peters campaign returned request for comment.Land called on Peters to return the investments he has made in the French oil giant in the wake of the DSCC's ad buy.""Congressman Gary Peters should immediately sell his $20,000 investment in pet coke, the very substance he tells voters is polluting Detroit and the substance that is the nexus of false attack ads launched by National Democrats like Senator Harry Reid and California billionaire Tom Steyer,"" Land said in a statement.Land has gone on the attack against Peters for his investments and environmentalist positions she says will cost Michigan good-paying jobs.""Gary Peters' friends are spending millions in attacks trying to falsely connect Terri Lynn Land to pet coke. Peters calls pet coke a dangerous pollutant, but he has $19,000 invested in a company that produces it, hoping to profit from pollution,"" the ad says. ""For Washington's Gary Peters, $19,000 is a little bit of stock, and a lot of hypocrisy.""Peters' portfolio has opened the Democratic candidate to numerous accusations of hypocrisy.While he professes deep opposition to outsourcing, he has invested thousands in a medical company that plans to dodge U.S. taxes by setting up shop in low tax Ireland. He also profited off of the Detroit water utility that is now shutting off service to poor residents. Land and water activists called on Peters to return those profits in August.""Cloud"" is the latest in a series of campaign spots produced by the DSCC for its multi-million dollar ad buy in Michigan. Despite its reputation as a deep blue state, Peters' lead in the race has fallen to within the margin of error in many polls.National Democrats and leading liberal interest groups are spending record amounts in the state. Harry Reid's super PAC has spent millions on attack ads and the DSCC has been forced to spend more money in Michigan in 2014 than it spent in the entire 2012 and 2008 campaigns combined.Peters and Land are running to replace retiring Democratic Sen.

0,Terri Lynn Land,"By Matthew BoyleTerri Lynn Land, Michigan's ex-Secretary of State and a Republican National Committeewoman, is running her U.S. Senate campaign on an aggressive conservative populist message that seems more fit for red state Republicans than a Republican running in a bluish-purple state like Michigan.A national mood against President Barack Obama is hurting Democrats, especially those who don't have the luxury of incumbency like Land's opponent Rep. Gary Peters (D-MI). Package all that together with a series of mishaps Peters and his campaign have made so far, and it puts Land in striking distance two months from election day.The biggest slip-up by Peters in Michigan--for which he still hasn't provided an answer--is that he told a group that ""immigration reform is not about enforcement."" There is also how Peters claims he is against outsourcing American jobs but actually engaged in the process as Michigan's lottery chief. Acccording to the Washington Free Beacon, he's been rolling in the dough, making thousands--potentially more--in profits off of outsourcing by an investment property of his.If that wasn't bad enough, Peters has claimed he's for equal pay for women and men in the U.S. job market but only pays women in his U.S. House office 67 cents for every dollar paid to men who work for him, according to a recent National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) hit on Peters.Land told Breitbart News in a phone interview:Starting right out with immigration, he tells one group it's important to secure the border but another group that it's not about enforcement. So it's nice to talk about it but where does he stand? And then as far as equal pay, when you're not paying the women in your own office the same as the men--and it's 67 cents on the dollar--that's not the place you should be. When I was Secretary of State, we actually created programs where men and women could learn skills for management so that when they were ready they could apply for management jobs and move up the ladder as far as pay and responsibilities and that's what you want to do in your job. We actually did it--by the time I left the Secretary of State's office, we had more women managers than when I started with a program that definitely worked. As far as outsourcing, he claims he's against that but yet did that when he was the lotto director and then also through the stimulus bill outsourced to foreign countries for car manufacturing. We build the best cars in America, and Detroit put America on wheels--and we do the best here in Michigan.The theme of Land's campaign is ""Michigan First,"" something she said in an interview means that she believes the role of government is to enact policies that help ordinary Americans--in her case, Michiganders--succeed economically. Land told Breitbart News:What we're talking about with Michigan First is jobs and the economy. Michigan has been through some tough times here and we need to make sure we have some good-paying jobs here in Michigan, and in order to do that we need to have a tax structure that's fair, simpler and lower. I went out and visited with businesses across this state--manufacturers, retailers--and they basically say they need stability. We need to know what the tax code is going to be, we need to know what the regulations are so we can invest in capital and grow our businesses so we have good-paying jobs.It may sound like House Budget Committee chairman Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI)--and his out-of-touch 2012 vice presidential campaign rhetoric of ""job creators"" that has since translated into his support for comprehensive immigration reform and amnesty for illegal aliens--all over again, but it's not. There's a key distinction here. The Washington establishment of the Republican Party has been focused for years on helping business owners--industry's elite players, a small group of wealthy but influential commercial titans. What Land is talking about is helping everyday workers, the people who vote in elections in America. And what she's doing is no accident: It's a coordinated message across her press strategy and policy strategy, and it's tapping into a national discontent with Washington, D.C.Land has offered a series of ""Michigan First"" plans on issues like immigration, transportation, and trade policy. Her transportation, or her ""Roads, Bridges and Highways Michigan First"" plan calls for a series of policy reforms that return power on infrastructure rebuilding back to the states and away from Washington, D.C., and her ""Michigan First"" trade policy isn't a traditional ""free trade"" deal--it calls for restrictions on outsourcing of American jobs to foreign countries so those jobs stay in the U.S. rather than go to increasingly globalized corporations around the world.Land's immigration plan, perhaps the most interesting of them all, focuses on how America's ""broken border with Mexico has cost Michigan jobs,"" honing in on the drastically negative economic effects of open borders policies on struggling Americans. It calls for tough interior and border enforcement, so that illegal aliens aren't getting jobs that Michigan's citizens and legal immigrants could be doing, and for blocking any amnesty for illegal aliens.And while the immigration plan is far from perfect--it does call for an increase in H1B high-tech visas in response to a supposed ""shortage"" of high-tech workers in the U.S. that experts like Robert Charette have argued in IEEE Spectrum magazine is based on false data--it does focus on low-skilled workers, on getting Americans back to work rather than helping illegal aliens.This is impressive for a Republican running in a state like Michigan. It allows Land to say she's pro-immigration reform, but only in support of reforms that are positive for the country and for Michigan--those that put ""Michigan First""--rather than the Democrats being able to paint her into a ""party of no"" box they've been trying to do with Republicans nationally for a long time.Land told Breitbart News:We need to reform our immigration system--it's too complex for folks that want to do it legally. It's too challenging. We need to make it so folks can go through the process to come here legally. Second, I'm a mom--and these children who have come across the border, we need to get them back to their parents. That should be a priority, and we need to do that. With the border, we need to secure the border and make sure people can't come here illegally--and then with all three of those, it will make the system work and work for our great country.Michigan's 2014 U.S. Senate race offers Republicans a chance to test out new, voter-focused messages aimed at detailing how liberal policies of the Democrats are hurting everyday people--rather than just the messages of the past few years of how the Democrats' policies are hurting wealthy businessmen. It lets Land say she's not anti-government, but in favor of making government serve the needs of her constituents rather than serve the needs of special interests and big-time donors.""As Secretary of State, it was all about customer service. We reduced the operation and reduced cost but delivered more services and were able to deliver a lot of them online,"" she said. ""We actually made government work for the people--that's my background of eight years, and I actually believe we can bring that to the federal government, make it work for the people. From that, that should be our priority.""That kind of logic applies especially to the Detroit bankruptcy situation. Liberal Democratic and big government policies sank Detroit to an all-time low, making it perhaps the biggest U.S. city to be forced into declaring bankruptcy. But it's practical policies from Republicans, Land says, that will pull it back from the flames and burst it back to life. According to Land:The good news is we have Gov. Snyder, who's working very hard with the emergency manager Kevyn Orr to get that on the right track. They've got a great plan--the folks in Detroit and across Michigan have been very supportive of that. They've got nonprofits and the autos who have contributed to the legacy cost of the pensions of employees with the city of Detroit. As I mentioned, Detroit put America on wheels, and they need to get the support they need to do that again. The good news is the pensioners came together on the plan and supported it, and we need everyone to come together and make sure Detroit is successful. We need Detroit to be successful for Michigan to be successful.What Land's doing is working: She's polling neck-and-neck with Peters, and the liberal leftwing billionaire hedge fund manager Tom Steyer--an architect behind funding a ""climate change"" battle in Congress--has dumped millions into Michigan to attack Land.""With Gary Peters slipping in the polls, national Democrats are spending over $1.8 million on the Michigan U.S. Senate race this week, and Steyer is committed to $2.6 million over the next 3 weeks, almost exclusively on ads attacking Terri Lynn Land,"" Joe Kildea, a Land campaign adviser, said in an email.Land is a few points back, according to the Real Clear Politics polling average, but she's stayed within a few points of Peters in most major polls--even taking some leads--since the end of 2013. A break or two for Land may blow this race, which most prognosticators are considering a toss-up, wide open. If she pulls that off, it would mean a Republican won in a blue state using a conservative populist message, yet again emboldening the cause of grassroots conservatives on a national level.",Breitbart - GOP's Terri Lynn Land Gains Momentum in Michigan Sen Race with 'Michigan First' Message

0,Terri Lynn Land,"Republican U.S. Senate candidate Terri Lynn Land on Tuesday unveiled a plan she said would improve Michigan roads by allowing the state to keep most federal gas taxes rather than await return appropriations.The plan is similar to a rejected Senate proposal that would have reduced reliance on the federal Highway Trust Fund, which is used for highway and mass transit projects around the country but has been running on fumes.Land's proposal would allow states to keep 15 cents of the 18.4-cent per-gallon federal gas tax, which is in addition to Michigan's own 19-cent gas tax. Federal block grants would be used to fund transportation projects during a multi-year transition period.The concept, which some call ""devolution,"" would cut out the ""the Washington middleman,"" giving Michigan and other states greater flexibility to design their own transportation funding mechanisms, according to a description on Land's website.""We know how to fix our roads and bridges, and what solutions work to reduce traffic congestion and keep Michigan roads safe,"" Land said in a statement.

""It's time to get D.C. out of the way and put Michigan First so we can finally fix our roads. My plan is simple: let's keep about 15 cents per gallon of what Michigan's motorists and truckers pay in federal gas taxes when we fill up our tanks. We know how to fix our roads and bridges, and what solutions work to reduce traffic congestion and keep Michigan roads safe.

Michigan sends tax dollars to Washington, D.C., but thanks to lobbyists and bureaucrats, Michigan doesn't get our fair share back.Terri's Michigan First Plan for Roads, Bridges and Highways Includes:Gradually Reduce the Federal Gas Tax: Over several years, Congress should reduce the 18.4 cents per gallon federal gas tax to around 4 cents and allow states to decide how they can best pay for the transportation infrastructure they need. During this transition, Michigan's transportation infrastructure projects would be funded through federal block grants.Eliminate Federal Bureaucratic Red Tape: States lose up to 20% of our gas tax dollars complying with Washington's rules and regulations. Cutting out the federal government will save billions of dollars over the long term. That means more money spent on asphalt and steel, and less on red tape.Let States Decide: Empowering states to make decisions about how to maintain, build, and upgrade their transportation infrastructure will produce better, more locally oriented decisions.

It is the finest in the world, and provides families with the food and fiber they need every day. In addition, our agricultural producers are major exporters too, sending their goods to markets all over the globe. American farmers today are the most productive in history due to innovative farm technology and better land management. I want to make sure that Michigan's farmers continue to be leading innovators in production agriculture.Helping family farmers succeed will help our State's economy expand and produce more jobs for our citizens. That is why I am committed to protecting our farmers by reducing harmful government regulations that hamper production agriculture. It is also why I support giving production agriculture the resources it needs to ensure food safety. One of the agriculture industry's most serious problems is ensuring an adequate supply of labor. I support policies that ensure our farmers have the labor necessary to maintain and grow their production levels. Helping family farms thrive helps drive our economy into more growth and job opportunities for all Michiganders.Terri's Solutions1. Reining in the EPA. The EPA has recently issued a series of damaging regulations that hurt Michigan farmers. I support common-sense efforts to rein in the EPA and will do my part as your U.S. Senator to provide robust oversight and accountability to this agency. Farmers, not Washington bureaucrats, are the best stewards of our land.2. Protecting Farmers. Farmers in Michigan and across the United States need to know that Washington's policies protect farmers. I strongly support crop insurance programs as well as other federal insurance programs to protect farmers when there is a drought or other type of natural disaster.3. The 2014 Farm Bill. I would have voted for the 2014 Farm Bill, however improvements could have been made to better help family farms, provide healthier and more efficient nutrition assistance to families, and all around be more fiscally responsible.4. Farm Labor. We need a visa system that reflects the seasonal and ongoing needs of Michigan's farmers. I support new agricultural visas for both seasonal and year-round workers.5. Protecting the Great Lakes. The Great Lakes are our state's greatest source of fresh water. I am committed to protecting Michigan's fresh water resources that are so essential to our agriculture and tourism industries.",Issue Position: Michigan Agriculture
0,Terri Lynn Land,"Trade policies from Washington all too often dramatically harm our state's economy and cost Michigan good-paying middle class jobs. I will only support trade agreements that put Michigan businesses and workers on a level playing field with other countries.Michigan First Plan: Free and Fair Trade TestBenefit Michigan Manufacturing, Automakers & Agriculture: Many past trade deals have disadvantaged Michigan manufacturing and automakers. From intellectual property protections to cybersecurity, agreements should have equal and mutual obligations to compete fairly, and if there are disputes, there should be a process to adjudicate them in a reasonable time frame. Finally, there should be some basic labor standards, so that American manufacturers and automakers are not at a significant competitive disadvantage.Ensure equal market access: In any future agreements, we should ensure that U.S. products have equal, or reciprocal, access to markets. The U.S. should not enter into trade deals in which we face unfair and unequal market restrictions.Ensure currency manipulations don't harm American-made products: The U.S. needs to begin using strong enforcement mechanisms against foreign countries that punish American-made products through currency manipulation. When a foreign country weakens its currency, which helps its products at the direct expense of American products, the U.S. should reduce or limit access to our markets until the manipulation stops.Current Trade Negotiations:Finalize U.S.-European free trade agreement (FTA): Trade agreements that are reciprocal, such as the Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), should become a high priority. Once the respective standards have been harmonized, trade agreements that open up new markets for American-made products on equal terms should be implemented promptly.Rewrite U.S.-Asian free trade agreement: Unless major changes are made to ensure reciprocal market access in the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), this FTA should not move forward. Unlike in the past, the U.S. should walk away from bad trade deals.",Issue Position: Free and Fair Trade
0,Terri Lynn Land,"For nearly a century, Michigan's manufacturers have had abundant supplies of energy to produce the best cars and other goods in the world. This was possible, in part, because America has had safe, reliable and stable sources of energy.In recent years, however, higher energy prices have made it harder for businesses to produce and ship goods at an affordable price. Rising gasoline and energy prices also strain family budgets. Energy is an essential ingredient to grow America's economy and to create jobs. Families and businesses suffer when energy prices rise.A major cause of price increases is the market uncertainty caused by instability in other regions of the world. Uncertainty in other parts of the world can negatively affect energy prices. As a result, the price your family pays at the pump is affected by what happens in the Middle East, South America and other parts of the globe.It doesn't have to be that way. Fortunately, America and our allies have rich and abundant sources of safe, clean energy. Many politicians in Washington, however, refuse to allow us to use safe and accessible sources of energy to grow our economy and create jobs. By making resources off limits with policies including opposition to the ""Keystone"" pipeline, politicians have hurt America's employment and energy security.As Michigan's next United States Senator, I will support policies that produce cleaner and affordable energy. I believe that we can use America's domestic resources and renewable energy in the United States. My commonsense energy policies will create jobs, reduce our dependence on Middle East Oil, create price stability for families and businesses and protect the environment.Terri's Solutions:1. Respect the Environment. Michigan's environment is important and we need to protect our state's resources. I support broad-based energy production however that production must protect our state's natural resources, like the Great Lakes.2. Domestic Energy Sources. I support an ""all of the above"" energy policy. We should look for abundant and more diverse sources of energy right here in the United States. I am in favor of the safe production and use of natural gas, oil, coal, nuclear, solar, wind and biofuels. I think we should expand domestic production of all of these sources of energy.3. Energy Diversity. One way to reduce our dependence on Middle East oil is to look to America's friends and allies to help meet America's energy needs. I support construction of the Keystone XL pipeline from Canada to the U.S. so our country has access to oil from North America, rather than the Middle East. I also support looking at importing energy from our other allies.",Issue Position: Energy Policy
0,Terri Lynn Land,"Michigan's roads have been in horrible shape for years. We should be able to agree that we need a new approach. It's time to get D.C. out of the way and put Michigan First so we can finally fix our roads.My plan is simple: let's keep about 15 cents per gallon of what Michigan's motorists and truckers pay in federal gas taxes when we fill up our tanks. We know how to fix our roads and bridges, and what solutions work to reduce traffic congestion and keep Michigan roads safe. We do not need D.C. telling us what to do or how to do it.Under the current broken system, we rely on those federal gas tax dollars for about 1/3 of our transportation budget. But remember, those dollars come from drivers in Michigan. We are taxed 37 cents per gallon of gasoline--just over 18 cents a gallon from Washington and 19 cents a gallon from Lansing. Rates for diesel are even higher.Too often, our money that goes to Washington gets run through the bureaucratic ringer and is returned to us with all sorts of mandates and strings attached, which add up to 20% in costs. Michigan's motorists are being shortchanged.We can do better than that. In fact, the whole process would be much more efficient if we didn't have to send Michigan's money to Washington in the first place.I want to be clear: I am not talking about cuts. I am talking about putting Michigan First by removing the Washington middleman and keeping our money closer to home -- closer to Michigan families driving to visit loved ones, closer to Michigan small businesses shipping their goods, and closer to Michigan's communities who rely on the roads to get our children to and from school safely.If we reduce the federal gas tax, states like Michigan will be free to design their own transportation funding mechanisms rather than a one-size-fits-all approach like the government is doing with health care. Let's let Michigan determine how much money we need and the best way to use it. In fact, many states are already taking steps to reform the way they fund transportation projects.The real question here is not about money. The real question is: Who is in charge of setting our transportation priorities, Michigan or Washington? On that question, the answer is clear to me: let's put Michigan First.My Michigan First plan for Roads, Bridges and Highways includes:Gradually reduce the Federal Gas Tax:Over several years, Congress should reduce the 18.4 cents per gallon federal gas tax to around 4 cents and allow states to decide how they can best pay for the transportation infrastructure they need. During this transition, Michigan's transportation infrastructure projects would be funded through federal block grants.Eliminate Federal Bureaucratic Red Tape: States lose up to 20% of our gas tax dollars complying with Washington's rules and regulations. Cutting out the federal government will save billions of dollars over the long term. That means more money spent on asphalt and steel, and less on red tape.Let States Decide: Empowering states to make decisions about how to maintain, build, and upgrade their transportation infrastructure will produce better, more locally oriented decisions. I want people from Michigan, not bureaucrats deciding how to run our transportation infrastructure.","Issue Position: Roads, Bridges and Highways"
0,Terri Lynn Land,"I have always been a strong supporter of Michigan manufacturing and all the hard-working men and women who contribute to it. From the world headquarters of the big three, to the small business manufacturers across the state, Michigan's manufacturing industry is the envy of the world.Our state has done its part to get our economy back on track. Unfortunately, Washington has failed to do its part to ensure the long-term health of the nation's economy. As a business owner, I know that things in Washington have to change, and we need to make reforms now so we don't face a repeat of the economic crisis.As Michigan's U.S. Senator, I will fight for policies to create an environment that allows Michigan's manufacturing industry to thrive for generations to come.Terri's Solutions1. Fair Trade: Developing fair trade agreements will open up markets to Michigan's exports.2. Predictability: Reforming the tax code will encourage job growth, increase capital investments, and make the U.S. more competitive, while providing Michigan's business with much needed stability and predictability.3. Modernizing Our Energy: Increasing America's domestic energy production and building the Keystone Pipeline will lower energy costs for manufacturers and families.4. Education: Working with states we can encourage and grow a skilled workforce.5.

0,Ruth Johnson,"U.S. Reps. Todd Rokita (IN-04) and Candice Miller (MI-10) today introduced the Voter Registration Integrity Act to direct states to implement a voter registration check and verification when individuals move. Currently, when individuals move out of state and register their new address with the state motor vehicle department, they are also asked if they would like to register to vote. The Voter Registration Integrity Act would require state motor vehicle departments to determine whether individuals want their new location to serve as their residence for voting in federal elections, and if so, to notify their former state of residence so they can be removed from the old voter registration rolls.""Voting is a right, but with that right, each voter has the responsibility to be legally registered and to follow all relevant laws in casting a ballot. Voter fraud is a proven danger that dilutes honest votes and erodes public confidence in our electoral process -- indeed, it threatens the very foundation of our republic,"" said Representative Todd Rokita. ""Preventing ineligible voters from casting ballots depends in large part on having accurate, clean records of eligible voters. As a former Indiana Secretary of State, I can attest that the Voter Registration Integrity Act will be a valuable tool to help state election administrators ensure the integrity of their voter rolls.""This bill, along with other legislation such as the landmark voter ID law that we passed in Indiana and successfully defended before the Supreme Court, will protect the right of every American to cast a ballot that counts. I can think of nothing more worthy of protection,"" said Rokita.As Indiana's chief election official from 2003 to 2011, Rokita was involved in the introduction, implementation, and defense of Indiana's landmark voter ID law -- which was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2008 -- as well as a much-needed clean-up of the state's out-of-date voter registration database.""The foundation of the American democratic system is the fundamental right to vote and the principle of one man, one vote,"" said Representative Candice Miller. ""When that principle is violated, the voting rights of all are diminished. I had the honor to serve as Michigan Secretary of State and the state's Chief Elections Officer for eight years. In that role I was responsible for conducting open, free and fair elections and that was a responsibility I took very seriously. It is also why I found it appalling when it was reported that a congressional candidate in the state of Maryland, Wendy Rosen, had registered to vote in both Maryland and Florida and voted in the 2006 and 2008 general elections and the 2008 Presidential Primary in both states. This type of behavior cannot be tolerated and we must make every effort to prevent it from happening in the future.""""In recent months I have been working with Michigan's current Secretary of State Ruth Johnson and my House colleague Todd Rokita, a former Secretary of State in Indiana, to look at changes in federal law that would put in place safeguards to make it less likely that any individual would cast ballots in multiple states in the same election,"" Miller continued. ""To address this problem, I introduced the Voter Registration Integrity Act along with Rep. Rokita which would amend the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 to provide state officials with additional tools to keep voter rolls clean. This bill would require state motor vehicle departments to ask new residents of their state who are seeking a driver license if he or she intends to register to vote in the new state. If the answer is yes, then the state motor vehicle department would notify the former state and allow the removal of that voter from their voter rolls.""""This is just common sense -- if you have voters registered in more than one state you are opening the door to cheating,"" said Michigan Secretary of State Ruth Johnson. ""Accurate voter rolls are critical to integrity in the elections process. That's why I've been pushing so hard to be able to remove those who have moved out of state, died or who are not U.S. citizens.""Johnson said Michigan this year participated in a joint project with 15 other states to compare and cross-check voter registration records to identify people registered to vote in more than one state and called initial numbers ""troubling."" It appears, though data is still being examined and verified, that about 72,000 Michigan residents are also registered to vote in other states like Arizona, Iowa, Kansas, Illinois and Tennessee, Johnson said.""Voter fraud hurts every legitimate citizen who lawfully exercises their sacred franchise. This bill is an important step in the right direction and it is my sincere hope we can enact it into law and protect the rights of every American,"" Miller concluded.","Rokita, Miller Introduce Voter Registration Integrity Act"
